BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD HIDDEN AWAY IN THE INMOST POCKET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEARCH
THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CALMING HIM
SUFFICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND BY HIS ORDERS WAS PLACED IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDSOME
THE VINE GREW OUTSIDE MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BOARDS ON WHICH WAS PAINTED A BOTTLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME
THE STREETS WERE NARROW AND UNPAVED BUT VERY FAIRLY CLEAN
IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALKING FROM THE TIME WE STARTED AND AFTER PASSING TWO OR THREE MORE VILLAGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDERABLE TOWN AND MY GUIDES MADE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHERED NO INKLING OF THEIR MEANING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APPREHENSION OF DANGER
THE DESIGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THING WAS CLEARLY THE SAME
THEY FELT MY PULSE THEY LOOKED AT MY TONGUE THEY LISTENED AT MY CHEST THEY FELT ALL MY MUSCLES AND AT THE END OF EACH OPERATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NODDED AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEASANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
I SAW A FEW SHEEP WITH ROUNDED NOSES AND ENORMOUS TAILS
EACH FEATURE WAS FINISHED EYELIDS EYELASHES AND EARS BEING ALMOST INVARIABLY PERFECT
I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHTED IN AND REVERENCED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIMPLY ABASHED IN THE PRESENCE OF SUCH A SPLENDID TYPE A COMPOUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN EGYPTIAN GREEK AND ITALIAN
HE BEGAN PRESENTLY TO RELENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KINDER MANNER
THE MEN WERE AS HANDSOME AS THE WOMEN BEAUTIFUL
EVEN ON THIS LEDGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY THERE WAS A STUNTED GROWTH OF SHOPLETS WHICH HAD TAKEN ROOT AND VEGETATED SOMEHOW THOUGH AS IN AN AIR MERCANTILE OF THE BLEAKEST
THE COUNTRY WAS HIGHLY CULTIVATED EVERY LEDGE BEING PLANTED WITH CHESTNUTS WALNUTS AND APPLE TREES FROM WHICH THE APPLES WERE NOW GATHERING
EVEN IN MIDDLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COMELY AND THE OLD GREY HAIRED WOMEN AT THEIR COTTAGE DOORS HAD A DIGNITY NOT TO SAY MAJESTY OF THEIR OWN
I EXPRESSED BY SIGNS MY ADMIRATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GUIDES AND THEY WERE GREATLY PLEASED
THE CHILDREN WERE INFINITE IN NUMBER AND EXCEEDINGLY MERRY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHARE OF THE PREVAILING BEAUTY
THEIR EXPRESSION WAS DIVINE AND AS THEY GLANCED AT ME TIMIDLY BUT WITH PARTED LIPS IN GREAT BEWILDERMENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERSION IN FEELINGS THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTHLY
WE PASSED MANY CASES AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCKS AND TWO OR THREE OLD WATCHES
MY GUIDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POLITENESS OF THE PEOPLE PREVENTED THEM FROM PUTTING ME TO ANY INCONVENIENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYEING ME NOR I THEM
THE OTHER LOOKED PALE AND ILL BUT HE WAS MARVELLOUSLY SELF CONTAINED AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAINLY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEALTH AND COUGHED VIOLENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SPITE OF MANIFEST EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT
SHORTLY AFTER PASSING ONE OF THESE CHAPELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILLAGE WHICH STARTED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS ALARMED LEST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CURIOSITY OR DISLIKE
AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CARRIAGE WHOSE WHEELS IN SPITE OF RUST AND DECAY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DESIGNED ORIGINALLY FOR IRON RAILS
IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RANGITATA DISTRICT OF THE CANTERBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRISTCHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY
THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUSE
THE FIRST EDITION OF EREWHON SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MOULDS AND AS THE DEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE
I ALSO WROTE ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION
ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISES TO THE PRINTER
I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOULDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STEREOS THEN MADE
I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EREWHON THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD
THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER
THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPYRIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS
PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION
THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE
I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRUBNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES
I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVOURABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH
IF THE READER WILL EXCUSE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY ANTECEDENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NATIVE COUNTRY THE NARRATIVE WOULD BE TEDIOUS TO HIM AND PAINFUL TO MYSELF
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED IN MY DESIGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO REAP ANY PECUNIARY ADVANTAGE
THE COUNTRY WAS THE GRANDEST THAT CAN BE IMAGINED
I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING EWES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET
THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SHEEP WHICH I KNEW AS TWO OR THREE BLACK EWES AND A BLACK LAMB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DISTINGUISHING MARK WHEREBY I COULD TELL THEM
SO LONELY AND SO SOLEMN WITH THE SAD GREY CLOUDS ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LAMB BLEATING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAKING
SHEEP AND CATTLE WERE INTRODUCED AND BRED WITH EXTREME RAPIDITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF COUNTRY GOING INLAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN ACRE BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RANGES WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND STATIONS EITHER FOR SHEEP OR CATTLE WERE SPOTTED ABOUT AT INTERVALS OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY
EACH MUST CRY LOUDER AND WANDER FARTHER YET MAY LUCK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHTFALL
IT IS SURPRISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO MISSING TWENTY SHEEP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED
IT WAS A MONOTONOUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEALTHY AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL
I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORKABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STOCK IT WITH BORROWED CAPITAL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE MAN
I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE
NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HONEST WILL DOUBT MY BEING SO
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO CROSS IT
I WOULD TRY THE NEARER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO
I REACHED MY DESTINATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTHS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT I DARE NOT MENTION THE SEASON LEST THE READER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH HEMISPHERE I WAS
VICTORIA BUNS SEVENTEEN THIRTY TWO
MODE BOIL THE RICE IN WATER UNTIL IT IS QUITE TENDER POUR OFF THE WATER AND PUT THE RICE BEFORE IT IS COLD TO THE FLOUR
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN
THESE BUNS MAY BE VARIED BY ADDING A FEW CURRANTS CANDIED PEEL OR CARAWAY SEEDS TO THE OTHER INGREDIENTS AND THE ABOVE MIXTURE ANSWERS FOR HOT CROSS BUNS BY PUTTING IN A LITTLE GROUND ALLSPICE AND BY PRESSING A TIN MOULD IN THE FORM OF A CROSS IN THE CENTRE OF THE BUN
SOME OF THE PREPARATIONS OF MAIZE FLOUR ARE VERY GOOD AND WHEN PARTAKEN IN MODERATION SUITABLE FOOD FOR ALMOST EVERYBODY
HOT ROLLS
SUFFICIENT ALLOW TWO CRUMPETS TO EACH PERSON
MUFFINS AND CRUMPETS SHOULD ALWAYS BE SERVED ON SEPARATE DISHES AND BOTH TOASTED AND SERVED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE
EXCELLENT ROLLS
IF CARRIED ANY DISTANCE IT SHOULD BE STORED AWAY IN AIR TIGHT VESSELS
FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES WILL BE REQUIRED TO BAKE THEM NICELY
TO MAKE GOOD HOME MADE BREAD
ANOTHER ADVANTAGE THE RED WHEATS POSSESS IS THEIR COMPARATIVE IMMUNITY FROM THE ATTACKS OF MILDEW AND FLY
MODE WHISK THE EGG STIR IN THE SUGAR AND BEAT THESE INGREDIENTS WELL TOGETHER BEAT THE BUTTER TO A CREAM STIR IN THE GROUND RICE CURRANTS AND CANDIED PEEL AND AS MUCH FLOUR AS WILL MAKE IT OF SUCH A CONSISTENCY THAT IT MAY BE ROLLED INTO SEVEN OR EIGHT BALLS
SEVENTEEN THIRTY FOUR
ILLUSTRATION ITALIAN MILLET
WHEN THEY ARE QUITE HOT DIVIDE THEM LENGTHWISE INTO THREE PUT SOME THIN FLAKES OF GOOD BUTTER BETWEEN THE SLICES PRESS THE ROLLS TOGETHER AND PUT THEM IN THE OVEN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO BUT NOT LONGER OR THE BUTTER WOULD OIL TAKE THEM OUT OF THE OVEN SPREAD THE BUTTER EQUALLY OVER DIVIDE THE ROLLS IN HALF AND PUT THEM ON TO A VERY HOT CLEAN DISH AND SEND THEM INSTANTLY TO TABLE
HE SAYS THAT BY CUTTING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE SLICES AT A TIME ALL THE BUTTER IS SQUEEZED OUT OF THE UPPER ONES WHILE THE BOTTOM ONE IS SWIMMING IN FAT LIQUID
ITALIAN RUSKS
A YELLOW VARIETY CALLED GOLDEN MILLET IS SOLD IN THE GROCERS SHOPS FOR MAKING PUDDINGS AND IS VERY DELICATE AND WHOLESOME
NEXT TAKE EITHER A LARGE TABLESPOONFUL OF BREWER'S YEAST WHICH HAS BEEN RENDERED SOLID BY MIXING IT WITH PLENTY OF COLD WATER AND LETTING IT AFTERWARDS STAND TO SETTLE FOR A DAY AND NIGHT OR NEARLY AN OUNCE OF GERMAN YEAST PUT IT INTO A LARGE BASIN AND PROCEED TO MIX IT SO THAT IT SHALL BE AS SMOOTH AS CREAM WITH THREE QUARTERS PINT OF WARM MILK AND WATER OR WITH WATER ONLY THOUGH EVEN A VERY LITTLE MILK WILL MUCH IMPROVE THE BREAD
TO MAKE HOT BUTTERED TOAST SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX
MOVE IT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS UNTIL THE BREAD IS NICELY COLOURED THEN TURN IT AND TOAST THE OTHER SIDE AND DO NOT PLACE IT SO NEAR THE FIRE THAT IT BLACKENS
MODE PUT THE FLOUR INTO A LARGE EARTHENWARE BOWL OR DEEP PAN THEN WITH A STRONG METAL OR WOODEN SPOON HOLLOW OUT THE MIDDLE BUT DO NOT CLEAR IT ENTIRELY AWAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN AS IN THAT CASE THE SPONGE OR LEAVEN AS IT WAS FORMERLY TERMED WOULD STICK TO IT WHICH IT OUGHT NOT TO DO
IT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED INTO ITALY WHERE THEY MAKE A COARSE BREAD FROM IT AND IT IS ALSO EMPLOYED IN PASTRY AND PUDDINGS THEY ALSO USE IT FOR FEEDING HORSES AND DOMESTIC FOWLS
THEY SHOULD BE KEPT IN A CLOSED TIN CANISTER IN A DRY PLACE TO PRESERVE THEIR CRISPNESS
SOYER RECOMMENDS THAT EACH SLICE SHOULD BE CUT INTO PIECES AS SOON AS IT IS BUTTERED AND WHEN ALL ARE READY THAT THEY SHOULD BE PILED LIGHTLY ON THE DISH THEY ARE INTENDED TO BE SERVED ON
SEVENTEEN TWENTY FOUR
TURN IT THEN ON TO A PASTE BOARD OR VERY CLEAN DRESSER AND WITH A LARGE SHARP KNIFE DIVIDE IT IN TWO MAKE IT UP QUICKLY INTO LOAVES AND DISPATCH IT TO THE OVEN MAKE ONE OR TWO INCISIONS ACROSS THE TOPS OF THE LOAVES AS THEY WILL RISE MORE EASILY IF THIS BE DONE
ILLUSTRATION RUSKS
CUT AS MANY NICE EVEN SLICES AS MAY BE REQUIRED RATHER MORE THAN ONE QUARTER INCH IN THICKNESS AND TOAST THEM BEFORE A VERY BRIGHT FIRE WITHOUT ALLOWING THE BREAD TO BLACKEN WHICH SPOILS THE APPEARANCE AND FLAVOUR OF ALL TOAST
NEVER USE NEW BREAD FOR MAKING ANY KIND OF TOAST AS IT EATS HEAVY AND BESIDES IS VERY EXTRAVAGANT
MODE PUT THE MILK AND BUTTER INTO A SAUCEPAN AND KEEP SHAKING IT ROUND UNTIL THE LATTER IS MELTED
THEN PLACE THE PAN ON A STRONG CHAIR OR DRESSER OR TABLE OF CONVENIENT HEIGHT POUR INTO THE SPONGE THE REMAINDER OF THE WARM MILK AND WATER STIR INTO IT AS MUCH OF THE FLOUR AS YOU CAN WITH THE SPOON THEN WIPE IT OUT CLEAN WITH YOUR FINGERS AND LAY IT ASIDE
IT WILL GROW ON POOR SOILS AND IS EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE
IT IS NOT CULTIVATED IN ENGLAND BEING PRINCIPALLY CONFINED TO THE EAST
WHEN WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE ARABIANS ARE FOND OF LIZARDS AND LOCUSTS AS ARTICLES OF FOOD THEIR CUISINE ALTOGETHER IS SCARCELY A TEMPTING ONE
ITALIAN MILLET OR GREAT INDIAN MILLET IS CULTIVATED IN EGYPT AND NUBIA WHERE IT IS CALLED DHOURRA AND IS USED AS HUMAN FOOD AS WELL AS FOR THE FERMENTATION OF BEER
LOOK AT IT FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN IT HAS BEEN LAID FOR NEARLY AN HOUR AND WHEN THE YEAST HAS RISEN AND BROKEN THROUGH THE FLOUR SO THAT BUBBLES APPEAR IN IT YOU WILL KNOW THAT IT IS READY TO BE MADE UP INTO DOUGH
WHEN COLD THEY SHOULD BE PUT INTO TIN CANISTERS TO KEEP THEM DRY AND IF INTENDED FOR THE CHEESE COURSE THE SIFTED SUGAR SHOULD BE OMITTED
TO MAKE DRY TOAST
A LOAF OF HOUSEHOLD BREAD ABOUT TWO DAYS OLD ANSWERS FOR MAKING TOAST BETTER THAN COTTAGE BREAD THE LATTER NOT BEING A GOOD SHAPE AND TOO CRUSTY FOR THE PURPOSE
SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN
MAIZE NEXT TO WHEAT AND RICE MAIZE IS THE GRAIN MOST USED IN THE NOURISHMENT OF MAN
SUFFICIENT TO MAKE TWELVE BUNS SEASONABLE AT ANY TIME LIGHT BUNS
MODE PUT THE FLOUR INTO A BASIN MIX THE SUGAR WELL WITH IT MAKE A HOLE IN THE CENTRE AND STIR IN THE YEAST AND MILK WHICH SHOULD BE LUKEWARM WITH ENOUGH OF THE FLOUR TO MAKE IT THE THICKNESS OF CREAM
SOUR MILK OR BUTTERMILK MAY BE USED BUT THEN A LITTLE LESS ACID WILL BE NEEDED
MODE LET THE TARTARIC ACID AND SALT BE REDUCED TO THE FINEST POSSIBLE POWDER THEN MIX THEM WELL WITH THE FLOUR

KIRKLEATHAM YEAST
VERY GOOD YOUR HONOUR SAYS TROKE
OH MISTER NORTH SAYS KIRKLAND WHY DID YOU STOP ME
WANTS TO COME OUT MISTER NORTH
VERY SORRY YOUR REVERENCE BUT YOUR REVERENCE KNOWS THAT I DAREN'T DO SUCH A THING
OH YOU MINISTERS OF CHRIST WOLVES IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING YOU SHALL BE JUDGED FOR THIS
KIRKLAND GHASTLY PALE BLEEDING WITH HIS WOOLLEN SHIRT TORN AND HIS BLUE EYES WIDE OPEN WITH TERROR WAS CLINGING TO THE BARS
MUST STOP THAT FIFTY LASHES TROKE
HE HAD BEEN A CLERK IN A BANKING HOUSE AND WAS TRANSPORTED FOR EMBEZZLEMENT THOUGH BY SOME GRAVE DOUBTS AS TO HIS GUILT WERE ENTERTAINED
DO HIM GOOD CURSE HIM
IF YOU FALL WE MUST FALL OVER YOU AND THEN YOU'RE DONE FOR
HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE BOY FLUNG HIMSELF BENEATH THE LOG
IT'S HARD FOR SUCH YOUNG UNS
WHEN THE MUSTER BELL RANG AND THE GANG BROKE UP RUFUS DAWES ON HIS SILENT WAY TO HIS SEPARATE CELL OBSERVED A NOTABLE CHANGE OF CUSTOM IN THE DISPOSITION OF THE NEW CONVICT
YOU CAN GUESS WHAT THAT UNHAPPY BOY HAS SUFFERED
I'M NOT TO GO IN THERE SAYS THE EX BANK CLERK DRAWING BACK IN DISMAY FROM THE CLOUD OF FOUL FACES WHICH LOWERED UPON HIM
HOLD ON TO ME MISS NANCY SAID THE GIANT I'M BIG ENOUGH TO CARRY DOUBLE
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN THAT THAT PLACE I WAS IN LAST NIGHT ASKED KIRKLAND
WHAT DOES HE CARE CARE
BUT KIRKLAND KEPT STEADILY ON FOR THE RIVER
WHAT IS HE MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE SAID THE WRETCHED MAN TO HIMSELF AS HE HUGGED HIS MISERY CLOSE
IMPERTINENT YOUNG BEGGAR SAID BURGESS
JUST AS HE REACHED IT HOWEVER THE FIGURE OF MISTER NORTH ROSE FROM BEHIND A PILE OF STONES
AND BEAT ON THE BARS WITH WHITE AND SWEATING HANDS
THAT LAST FELLOW YOU HAD OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TIED UP HIMSELF
LET HIM OUT CRIED NORTH AGAIN STAMPING HIS FOOT
ABOUT DAWN THE NEXT MORNING MISTER NORTH WHO AMONGST OTHER VAGARIES NOT APPROVED OF BY HIS BISHOP HAD A HABIT OF PROWLING ABOUT THE PRISON AT UNOFFICIAL HOURS WAS ATTRACTED BY A DISPUTE AT THE DOOR OF THE DORMITORY
A PRISONER REFRACTORY YOUR REVERENCE SAID THE WATCHMAN
THERE'S MORE TROUBLE WITH YOU BLOODY ARISTOCRATS THAN ENOUGH LIE QUIET
I WON'T HAVE MY MEN KNOCKED UP WITH FLOGGING THESE RASCALS
I ORDER YOU SIR NORTH CRIED INDIGNANT
KIRKLAND JUMPED FOR THE JETTY MISSED HIS FOOTING AND FELL INTO THE ARMS OF THE CHAPLAIN
MACKLEWAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD SERIOUSLY
OH GOD GIVE ME STRENGTH AID ME HELP ME
SO THEY WENT ON TO THE VERANDAH AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE LIGHTS OF THE PRISON AND LISTENED TO THE SEA LAPPING THE SHORE
THE GOVERNMENT MAY GO TO AND YOU TOO ROARED BURGESS GET OUT
ABANDONED INDEED BY GOD AND MAN ALMOST
THERE'S NO FEAR OF HIM SAID BURGESS CHEERILY IF HE GROWS UPROARIOUS WE'LL SOON GIVE HIM A TOUCH OF THE CAT
DOCTOR WE ALL HAVE OUR CROSSES HAVE WE NOT
HOW DELIGHTFUL THE GRASS SMELLS
HE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TRULY PENITENT FOR HIS OFFENCES A MISGUIDED BUT NOT A HYPOCRITICAL MAN IF MY KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE GOES FOR ANYTHING I HOPE HE IS SAID NORTH
CAPTAIN FRERE SAYS THAT THE SCENERY IS DELIGHTFUL
THEY SHALL NOT FLOG THAT BOY HE SAID
THE REVEREND MEEKIN EYED HIS CLERICAL BROTHER WITH HORROR THE REVEREND MEEKIN WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO CLERGYMEN WHO WORE BLACK NECKTIES SMOKED CLAY PIPES CHEWED TOBACCO AND DRANK NEAT BRANDY OUT OF TUMBLERS
O LORD LOOK DOWN UPON ME
AN IMPULSIVE GENTLEMAN SAID MEEKIN TO MACKLEWAIN AS THE SOUND OF MISTER NORTH'S FOOTSTEPS DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE
YOU'RE A DISMISSED OFFICER OF THE GOVERNMENT SIR
I WAS QUARTERED WITH HIM AT SARAH ISLAND
THE DEVIL HE IS I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT IT TOO
I'VE GIVEN MY ORDERS SIR
PERHAPS YOU'LL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ALLOW ME TO BE THE BEST JUDGE OF THAT RETURNED MACKLEWAIN DRAWING UP HIS LITTLE BODY TO ITS LEAST INSIGNIFICANT STATURE
TWICE HE PAUSED ON THE WAY TO THE SITTING ROOM AND TWICE WAS HE DRIVEN ON BY A POWER STRONGER THAN HIS WILL
BEFORE THE TWO CLERGYMEN HAD GOT HALF WAY DOWN THE STEEP PATH THAT LED FROM THE COMMANDANT'S HOUSE TO THE FLAT ON WHICH THE COTTAGES OF THE DOCTOR AND CHAPLAIN WERE BUILT MACKLEWAIN REJOINED THEM
OUR ROADS LIE TOGETHER DOCTOR
HE SMELT THE NUTTY AROMA OF THE SPIRIT
YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY HE'S GOING TO FLOG KIRKLAND
THEN CAPTAIN BURGESS CRIED NORTH HIS PALE FACE FLUSHING I TELL YOU THE BOY'S BLOOD WILL BE ON YOUR HEAD
HE IS JUST MARRIED YOU KNOW IS HE SAID BURGESS
HAVE YOU MANY VISITORS CAPTAIN BURGESS VERY FEW
THIS OF COURSE WAS MERE BRAVADO ON THE PART OF THE COMMANDANT
WHOM IS HE GOING TO FLOG NOW
THAT AT ALL TIMES DEBASING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME IT WAS INFAMOUS THAT A VICE UNWORTHY OF ANY MAN WAS DOUBLY SINFUL IN A MAN OF EDUCATION AND A MINISTER OF GOD IN VAIN
THAT'S MACKLEWAIN'S BUSINESS
IN FACT THE RINGLEADER JOHN REX GAVE ME HIS CONFESSION AND I SENT IT TO THE BISHOP
PRAY HELP YOURSELF TO WINE
NORTH KNEW WELL THAT HE WOULD NEVER DARE TO ATTEMPT ANY SUCH ACT OF VIOLENCE BUT THE INSULT STUNG HIM LIKE THE CUT OF A WHIP
BUT MACKLEWAIN WAS TIRED AND WANTED TO GET HOME
IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD REACHED THE CRISIS OF A DISEASE WHICH HAD BEEN FOR DAYS GATHERING FORCE
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT EVIDENCE COMPLAIN
I AM A MINISTER OF GOD SIR AND I FORBID YOU TO COMMIT THIS CRIME
I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING HIM IN SOCIETY
SO HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS EH
DAMN YOUR IMPERTINENCE SIR BURST OUT BURGESS
MISTER MEEKIN EXPRESSED SOME ALARM BUT DOCTOR MACKLEWAIN RE ASSURED HIM
I MUST HAVE A TEASPOONFUL HE SAID TO ALLAY THE CRAVING
DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU MISTER MEEKIN
SHOW MISTER NORTH OUT HE SAID AND GO DOWN TO THE BARRACKS AND TELL TROKE THAT KIRKLAND IS TO HAVE A HUNDRED LASHES TO MORROW
IF YOU PLEASE SAID MEEKIN GRAVELY
YES ONE OUGHTN'T TO LEAVE THE COLONY WITHOUT SEEING IT SAYS BURGESS IT'S WORTH SEEING
THEN DON'T YOU INTERFERE WITH ME SIR
IN THE MIDST OF HIS ARGUMENTS HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE CUPBOARD WITH THE BOTTLE AT HIS LIPS IN AN ATTITUDE THAT WAS AT ONCE LUDICROUS AND HORRIBLE
ANOTHER FLOGGING TO MORROW SAID HE GRUMBLINGLY
DEAD SAID DOCTOR MACKLEWAIN
HE MIXED A TEASPOONFUL OF THIS IN A PANNIKIN OF WATER AND DRANK IT
HE SLEEPS AT THE BACK AND NORTH HURRIED OFF
I HAVE THESE ATTACKS AT TIMES
I'LL REPORT THIS TO THE GOVERNMENT
UNLESS IT'S A CANCER IN THE STOMACH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT CAN BE CANCER IN THE STOMACH
GOOD NIGHT SIR I HOPE YOU WILL BE COMFORTABLE
WELL NOW SAID MEEKIN WITH ASPERITY I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN LONG IN THE COLONY MISTER MEEKIN
I'LL SHOW YOU WHO'S MASTER HERE MY GOOD SIR
THIS IS MURDEROUS
IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH HE IS WITH US
A GREAT RASCAL PUT IN NORTH
I'LL TEACH MY PRISONERS TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE
HE HAS THE STRANGEST FITS AT TIMES
I WISH I HADN'T TAKEN THAT BRANDY HE SAID FOOL THAT I AM
I SUPPOSE SEVERITY IS NECESSARY RETURNED MEEKIN THOUGH TO MY EARS A FLOGGING SOUNDS A LITTLE DISTASTEFUL
I SHALL FIND MY PORTMANTEAU IN MY ROOM YOU SAID YES YES
IT RELIEVED HIM FOR A WHILE
BY AND BY A SHORT FIGURE SMOKING A CHEROOT CAME UP OUT OF THE DARK AND PROVED TO BE DOCTOR MACKLEWAIN WHO HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM ATTENDING THE DINNER BY REASON OF AN ACCIDENT TO A CONSTABLE AT NORFOLK BAY WHICH HAD CLAIMED HIS PROFESSIONAL ATTENTION
SHE DOESN'T PICK THEM UP BUT JUST HAVING THEM IN THE ROOM SURE DOESN'T GIVE HER ASTHMA
POP GOES RIGHT ON TUNING HIS CHANNEL
I TOLD TOM WE SHOULDN'T COME SO LATE SAYS HILDA
WELL I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TURN A GUY'S T V PROGRAM OFF IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT EVEN FINDING OUT ABOUT IT
I LOOK AT MY WATCH IT'S A QUARTER TO ELEVEN
TOM SAYS THANKS AND LOOKS AT HILDA AND SHE BLUSHES REALLY
YOU'RE GETTING ALTOGETHER TOO UPSET ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS STOP IT AND BEHAVE YOURSELF
WHEN ARE YOU GETTING RID OF THESE CATS I'M NOT FIXING TO START AN ANNEX TO KATE'S CAT HOME
TOM DRINKS A LITTLE MORE COFFEE AND THEN HE GOES ON THE TROUBLE IS I CAN'T GET MARRIED ON THIS FLOWER SHOP JOB
I'LL BE LUCKY IF I HAVE TIME TO BREATHE
HERE'S TO YOU A LONG HAPPY LIFE
RIGHT AWAY WHEN I BRING HOME MY NEW PROGRAM HE SAYS HOW COME YOU'RE TAKING ONE LESS COURSE THIS HALF
AS LONG AS THERE'S A BONE ON THE FLOOR THE TWO OF YOU WORRY IT
I GET THE PILLOWS COMFORTABLY ARRANGED ON THE FLOOR WITH A BIG BOTTLE OF SODA AND A BAG OF POPCORN WITHIN EASY REACH
I EXPLAIN THAT I'M TAKING MUSIC AND ALSO BIOLOGY ALGEBRA ENGLISH AND FRENCH MUSIC HE SNORTS
SOMETIMES SCHOOLS DO LET KIDS TAKE A LOT OF SOFT COURSES AND THEN THEY'RE OUT ON A LIMB LATER HUH
YOU KNOW I'D GET DRAFTED IN A YEAR OR TWO ANYWAY
I'VE DECIDED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY
SO HE CARES HUH
POP IT'S A COURSE
HE DOES AND FOR ONCE I WIN A ROUND I KEEP MUSIC FOR THIS SEMESTER
BESIDES SAYS TOM HALF THE REASON YOU AND YOUR FATHER ARE ALWAYS BICKERING IS THAT YOU'RE SO MUCH ALIKE ME LIKE HIM SURE
I'LL HAVE TO CHECK SOME MORE SAYS TOM
IT'S YOUR FAULT MOP IT UP YOURSELF
THE TWO STRAY KITTENS GRADUALLY MAKE THEMSELVES AT HOME
I TURN OFF THE TELEVISION SET I'VE LOST TRACK OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE GRANDFATHER WHO'S THE SPOOK AFTER ALL
IT'S THE FIRST TIME HILDA HAS BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND TOM INTRODUCES HER AROUND
SOMEHOW OR OTHER CAT HAS TAUGHT THEM THAT HE'S IN CHARGE HERE AND HE JUST CHASES THEM FOR FUN NOW AND AGAIN WHEN HE'S NOT BUSY SLEEPING
I HEAR THE T V GOING FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN POP TURNS IT OFF AND GOES IN THE KITCHEN TO TALK TO MOM
HE STRUCK AMBROSCH ON THE BACK AND THE BOY SMILED KNOWINGLY
NOW WHY IS THAT OTTO
ANTONIA POINTED UP TO THE SKY AND QUESTIONED ME WITH HER GLANCE
WE STOOD PANTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US
I NOTICED HOW WHITE AND WELL SHAPED HIS OWN HANDS WERE
SHE POINTED INTO THE GOLD COTTONWOOD TREE BEHIND WHOSE TOP WE STOOD AND SAID AGAIN WHAT NAME
IT'S NO BETTER THAN A BADGER HOLE NO PROPER DUGOUT AT ALL
AMBROSCH HE MAKE GOOD FARMER
SHE WAS QUICK AND VERY EAGER
THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORNCAKES AND SORGHUM MOLASSES FOR THREE DAYS
I BECAME SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED FOR I WAS USED TO BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY MY ELDERS
HE WAS BORN LIKE THAT THE OTHERS ARE SMART
VERY GLAD VERY GLAD SHE EJACULATED
PRESENTLY AGAINST ONE OF THOSE BANKS I SAW A SORT OF SHED THATCHED WITH THE SAME WINE COLORED GRASS THAT GREW EVERYWHERE
EVEN FROM A DISTANCE ONE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS BOY
WHEN I CAME UP HE TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY DOWN INTO MY FACE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS
SHE MADE MISSUS SHIMERDA UNDERSTAND THE FRIENDLY INTENTION OF OUR VISIT AND THE BOHEMIAN WOMAN HANDLED THE LOAVES OF BREAD AND EVEN SMELLED THEM AND EXAMINED THE PIES WITH LIVELY CURIOSITY EXCLAIMING MUCH GOOD MUCH THANK
SHE GOT UP ON HER KNEES AND WRUNG HER HANDS
AFTER ANTONIA HAD SAID THE NEW WORDS OVER AND OVER SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE CHASED SILVER RING SHE WORE ON HER MIDDLE FINGER
MY GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS SPOKE IN A VERY LOUD TONE TO FOREIGNERS AS IF THEY WERE DEAF
HER SKIN WAS BROWN TOO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK COLOR
I REMEMBERED WHAT THE CONDUCTOR HAD SAID ABOUT HER EYES
YOU'LL GET FIXED UP COMFORTABLE AFTER WHILE MISSUS SHIMERDA MAKE GOOD HOUSE
WE WERE SO DEEP IN THE GRASS THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE BLUE SKY OVER US AND THE GOLD TREE IN FRONT OF US
OCCASIONALLY ONE OF THE HORSES WOULD TEAR OFF WITH HIS TEETH A PLANT FULL OF BLOSSOMS AND WALK ALONG MUNCHING IT THE FLOWERS NODDING IN TIME TO HIS BITES AS HE ATE DOWN TOWARD THEM
IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT BUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRAITS I REMEMBERED IN VIRGINIA
SHE LOOKED AT ME HER EYES FAIRLY BLAZING WITH THINGS SHE COULD NOT SAY
THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HAT ON AND THE GIRLS SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM
AT THAT MOMENT THE FATHER CAME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE BANK
FUCHS BROUGHT UP A SACK OF POTATOES AND A PIECE OF CURED PORK FROM THE CELLAR AND GRANDMOTHER PACKED SOME LOAVES OF SATURDAY'S BREAD A JAR OF BUTTER AND SEVERAL PUMPKIN PIES IN THE STRAW OF THE WAGON BOX
IN ARISTOCRACIES EVERY MAN HAS ONE SOLE OBJECT WHICH HE UNCEASINGLY PURSUES BUT AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE EXISTENCE OF MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THE SAME MIND WILL ALMOST ALWAYS EMBRACE SEVERAL OBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME AND THESE OBJECTS ARE FREQUENTLY WHOLLY FOREIGN TO EACH OTHER AS IT CANNOT KNOW THEM ALL WELL THE MIND IS READILY SATISFIED WITH IMPERFECT NOTIONS OF EACH
IF I APPLAUD THE FREEDOM WHICH ITS INHABITANTS ENJOY HE ANSWERS FREEDOM IS A FINE THING BUT FEW NATIONS ARE WORTHY TO ENJOY IT
IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THE GREAT POSSESS IMMENSE PRIVILEGES UPON WHICH THEIR PRIDE RESTS WITHOUT SEEKING TO RELY UPON THE LESSER ADVANTAGES WHICH ACCRUE TO THEM
CHAPTER SIXTEEN WHY THE NATIONAL VANITY OF THE AMERICANS IS MORE RESTLESS AND CAPTIOUS THAN THAT OF THE ENGLISH
IN ARISTOCRATIC COMMUNITIES THE PEOPLE READILY GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO BURSTS OF TUMULTUOUS AND BOISTEROUS GAYETY WHICH SHAKE OFF AT ONCE THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR PRIVATIONS THE NATIVES OF DEMOCRACIES ARE NOT FOND OF BEING THUS VIOLENTLY BROKEN IN UPON AND THEY NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THEIR OWN SELVES WITHOUT REGRET
AN AMERICAN INSTEAD OF GOING IN A LEISURE HOUR TO DANCE MERRILY AT SOME PLACE OF PUBLIC RESORT AS THE FELLOWS OF HIS CALLING CONTINUE TO DO THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE SHUTS HIMSELF UP AT HOME TO DRINK
WHEN AN ARISTOCRACY CARRIES ON THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ITS NATIONAL PRIDE NATURALLY ASSUMES THIS RESERVED INDIFFERENT AND HAUGHTY FORM WHICH IS IMITATED BY ALL THE OTHER CLASSES OF THE NATION
I BELIEVE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE AMERICANS ARISES PARTLY FROM THEIR PRIDE
THIS IS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE AMONGST THOSE FREE NATIONS WHICH FORM DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES
THESE PERSONS THEN DISPLAYED TOWARDS EACH OTHER PRECISELY THE SAME PUERILE JEALOUSIES WHICH ANIMATE THE MEN OF DEMOCRACIES THE SAME EAGERNESS TO SNATCH THE SMALLEST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEIR EQUALS CONTESTED AND THE SAME DESIRE TO PARADE OSTENTATIOUSLY THOSE OF WHICH THEY WERE IN POSSESSION
THE AMERICANS IN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH STRANGERS APPEAR IMPATIENT OF THE SMALLEST CENSURE AND INSATIABLE OF PRAISE
THEY THEREFORE ENTERTAIN A CALM SENSE OF THEIR SUPERIORITY THEY DO NOT DREAM OF VAUNTING PRIVILEGES WHICH EVERYONE PERCEIVES AND NO ONE CONTESTS AND THESE THINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY NEW TO THEM TO BE MADE TOPICS OF CONVERSATION
THEN THERE ARE IN ALL CLASSES A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF MEN CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED WITH THE SERIOUS AFFAIRS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE WHOLLY ENGROSSED BY THE ACQUISITION OF A PRIVATE FORTUNE
I DO NOT BELIEVE IN SUCH REPUBLICS ANY MORE THAN IN THAT OF PLATO OR IF THE THINGS WE READ OF REALLY HAPPENED I DO NOT HESITATE TO AFFIRM THAT THESE SUPPOSED DEMOCRACIES WERE COMPOSED OF VERY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS FROM OURS AND THAT THEY HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE LATTER EXCEPT THEIR NAME
THEY STAND UNMOVED IN THEIR SOLITARY GREATNESS WELL ASSURED THAT THEY ARE SEEN OF ALL THE WORLD WITHOUT ANY EFFORT TO SHOW THEMSELVES OFF AND THAT NO ONE WILL ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THEM FROM THAT POSITION
IF I SAY TO AN AMERICAN THAT THE COUNTRY HE LIVES IN IS A FINE ONE AY HE REPLIES THERE IS NOT ITS FELLOW IN THE WORLD
IF IT SHOULD BE IN AN UNSOUND STATE IT MUST BE ON NO ACCOUNT MADE USE OF
MODE PUT THE MILK IN A VERY CLEAN SAUCEPAN AND LET IT BOIL
THEN ADD THE YOLKS OF THE EGGS WELL BEATEN STIR THEM TO THE SAUCE BUT DO NOT ALLOW IT TO BOIL AND SERVE VERY HOT
WHEN THE THREE INGREDIENTS ARE PROPERLY PREPARED POUND THEM ALTOGETHER IN A MORTAR FOR SOME TIME FOR THE MORE QUENELLES ARE POUNDED THE MORE DELICATE THEY ARE

THE LEMON WAS FIRST CULTIVATED IN ENGLAND IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY AND IS NOW OFTEN TO BE FOUND IN OUR GREEN HOUSES

ILLUSTRATION THE CUCUMBER
SOLID ROCKS OF SALT ARE ALSO FOUND IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD AND THE COUNTY OF CHESTER CONTAINS MANY OF THESE MINES AND IT IS FROM THERE THAT MUCH OF OUR SALT COMES
OTHER SWEET HERBS ARE CULTIVATED FOR PURPOSES OF MEDICINE AND PERFUMERY THEY ARE MOST GRATEFUL BOTH TO THE ORGANS OF TASTE AND SMELLING AND TO THE AROMA DERIVED FROM THEM IS DUE IN A GREAT MEASURE THE SWEET AND EXHILARATING FRAGRANCE OF OUR FLOWERY MEADS

WHAT WILL THE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS WHO APPEAR AT THIS TIME HAVE TO PREACH
EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND SO IT WILL ALWAYS BE A SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS AND REQUIRING SLAVERY IN SOME FORM OR OTHER
ON THIS ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE OF ONE NATION UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN THOSE BELONGING TO DIFFERENT NATIONS EVEN WHEN THEY USE THE SAME LANGUAGE OR RATHER WHEN PEOPLE HAVE LIVED LONG TOGETHER UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE SOIL DANGER REQUIREMENT TOIL THERE ORIGINATES THEREFROM AN ENTITY THAT UNDERSTANDS ITSELF NAMELY A NATION
THE GREATER THE DANGER THE GREATER IS THE NEED OF AGREEING QUICKLY AND READILY ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY NOT TO MISUNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER IN DANGER THAT IS WHAT CANNOT AT ALL BE DISPENSED WITH IN INTERCOURSE
THE DISTINCTIONS OF MORAL VALUES HAVE EITHER ORIGINATED IN A RULING CASTE PLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS OF BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE RULED OR AMONG THE RULED CLASS THE SLAVES AND DEPENDENTS OF ALL SORTS
THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF RACE
THE HIGHEST INSTINCT FOR PURITY PLACES HIM WHO IS AFFECTED WITH IT IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND DANGEROUS ISOLATION AS A SAINT FOR IT IS JUST HOLINESS THE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE INSTINCT IN QUESTION
BUT YOU MISUNDERSTAND HIM WHEN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT IT
IN FACT CONFORMABLY TO THE SLOW RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL ORDER AND ITS CAUSE THE BLENDING OF THE BLOOD OF MASTERS AND SLAVES THE ORIGINALLY NOBLE AND RARE IMPULSE OF THE MASTERS TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO THEMSELVES AND TO THINK WELL OF THEMSELVES WILL NOW BE MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED AND EXTENDED BUT IT HAS AT ALL TIMES AN OLDER AMPLER AND MORE RADICALLY INGRAINED PROPENSITY OPPOSED TO IT AND IN THE PHENOMENON OF VANITY THIS OLDER PROPENSITY OVERMASTERS THE YOUNGER
HERE IS THE SEAT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS ANTITHESIS GOOD AND EVIL POWER AND DANGEROUSNESS ARE ASSUMED TO RESIDE IN THE EVIL A CERTAIN DREADFULNESS SUBTLETY AND STRENGTH WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF BEING DESPISED
ACCORDING TO SLAVE MORALITY THEREFORE THE EVIL MAN AROUSES FEAR ACCORDING TO MASTER MORALITY IT IS PRECISELY THE GOOD MAN WHO AROUSES FEAR AND SEEKS TO AROUSE IT WHILE THE BAD MAN IS REGARDED AS THE DESPICABLE BEING
THE MOST VARIED EXPERIENCE TEACHES IT WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY OWES THE FACT THAT IT STILL EXISTS IN SPITE OF ALL GODS AND MEN AND HAS HITHERTO BEEN VICTORIOUS THESE QUALITIES IT CALLS VIRTUES AND THESE VIRTUES ALONE IT DEVELOPS TO MATURITY
THERE MUST BE A SORT OF REPUGNANCE IN ME TO BELIEVE ANYTHING DEFINITE ABOUT MYSELF IS THERE PERHAPS SOME ENIGMA THEREIN
OCCASIONALLY TOO THE WAKING CALL COMES TOO LATE THE CHANCE WHICH GIVES PERMISSION TO TAKE ACTION WHEN THEIR BEST YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR ACTION HAVE BEEN USED UP IN SITTING STILL AND HOW MANY A ONE JUST AS HE SPRANG UP HAS FOUND WITH HORROR THAT HIS LIMBS ARE BENUMBED AND HIS SPIRITS ARE NOW TOO HEAVY
PROBABLY BUT FORTUNATELY NOTHING FOR MY OWN TEETH PERHAPS IT BETRAYS THE SPECIES TO WHICH I BELONG BUT NOT TO MYSELF AS IS SUFFICIENTLY AGREEABLE TO ME BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
A MAN'S ESTIMATES OF VALUE BETRAY SOMETHING OF THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SOUL AND WHEREIN IT SEES ITS CONDITIONS OF LIFE ITS INTRINSIC NEEDS
EVERYWHERE THAT SLAVE MORALITY GAINS THE ASCENDANCY LANGUAGE SHOWS A TENDENCY TO APPROXIMATE THE SIGNIFICATIONS OF THE WORDS GOOD AND STUPID
AND WHOEVER THOU ART WHAT IS IT THAT NOW PLEASES THEE
HE HONOURS WHATEVER HE RECOGNIZES IN HIMSELF SUCH MORALITY EQUALS SELF GLORIFICATION
VARIATIONS WHETHER THEY BE DEVIATIONS INTO THE HIGHER FINER AND RARER OR DETERIORATIONS AND MONSTROSITIES APPEAR SUDDENLY ON THE SCENE IN THE GREATEST EXUBERANCE AND SPLENDOUR THE INDIVIDUAL DARES TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND DETACH HIMSELF
AT THIS TURNING POINT OF HISTORY THERE MANIFEST THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE AND OFTEN MIXED AND ENTANGLED TOGETHER A MAGNIFICENT MANIFOLD VIRGIN FOREST LIKE UP GROWTH AND UP STRIVING A KIND OF TROPICAL TEMPO IN THE RIVALRY OF GROWTH AND AN EXTRAORDINARY DECAY AND SELF DESTRUCTION OWING TO THE SAVAGELY OPPOSING AND SEEMINGLY EXPLODING EGOISMS WHICH STRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR SUN AND LIGHT AND CAN NO LONGER ASSIGN ANY LIMIT RESTRAINT OR FORBEARANCE FOR THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF THE HITHERTO EXISTING MORALITY
PROBABLY A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION WITH REGARD TO THE ENTIRE SITUATION OF MAN WILL FIND EXPRESSION PERHAPS A CONDEMNATION OF MAN TOGETHER WITH HIS SITUATION
ONLY NAME IT WHATEVER I HAVE I OFFER THEE
OR HE WILL EVEN SAY FOR MANY REASONS I CAN DELIGHT IN THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE I LOVE AND HONOUR THEM AND REJOICE IN ALL THEIR JOYS PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE THEIR GOOD OPINION ENDORSES AND STRENGTHENS MY BELIEF IN MY OWN GOOD OPINION PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS EVEN IN CASES WHERE I DO NOT SHARE IT IS USEFUL TO ME OR GIVES PROMISE OF USEFULNESS ALL THIS HOWEVER IS NOT VANITY
PROFOUND SUFFERING MAKES NOBLE IT SEPARATES ONE OF THE MOST REFINED FORMS OF DISGUISE IS EPICURISM ALONG WITH A CERTAIN OSTENTATIOUS BOLDNESS OF TASTE WHICH TAKES SUFFERING LIGHTLY AND PUTS ITSELF ON THE DEFENSIVE AGAINST ALL THAT IS SORROWFUL AND PROFOUND
I DO NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY PERHAPS THE HARPIES HAVE FLOWN OVER MY TABLE
WE TRUTHFUL ONES THE NOBILITY IN ANCIENT GREECE CALLED THEMSELVES
NOTHING BUT NEW WHYS NOTHING BUT NEW HOWS NO COMMON FORMULAS ANY LONGER MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISREGARD IN LEAGUE WITH EACH OTHER DECAY DETERIORATION AND THE LOFTIEST DESIRES FRIGHTFULLY ENTANGLED THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVERFLOWING FROM ALL THE CORNUCOPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD A PORTENTOUS SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF SPRING AND AUTUMN FULL OF NEW CHARMS AND MYSTERIES PECULIAR TO THE FRESH STILL INEXHAUSTED STILL UNWEARIED CORRUPTION
TO SUFFOCATE WITH HIS MEMORIES TO HIM WHO HAS THE DESIRES OF A LOFTY AND DAINTY SOUL AND ONLY SELDOM FINDS HIS TABLE LAID AND HIS FOOD PREPARED THE DANGER WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT NOWADAYS HOWEVER IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY SO
ALSO IN ALL LOVES AND FRIENDSHIPS ONE HAS THE EXPERIENCE THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND CONTINUES WHEN THE DISCOVERY HAS BEEN MADE THAT IN USING THE SAME WORDS ONE OF THE TWO PARTIES HAS FEELINGS THOUGHTS INTUITIONS WISHES OR FEARS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE OTHER
IN OUR VERY DEMOCRATIC OR RATHER VERY PLEBEIAN AGE EDUCATION AND CULTURE MUST BE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF DECEIVING DECEIVING WITH REGARD TO ORIGIN WITH REGARD TO THE INHERITED PLEBEIANISM IN BODY AND SOUL
THE NOBLE SOUL ACCEPTS THE FACT OF HIS EGOISM WITHOUT QUESTION AND ALSO WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS OF HARSHNESS CONSTRAINT OR ARBITRARINESS THEREIN BUT RATHER AS SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE ITS BASIS IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF THINGS IF HE SOUGHT A DESIGNATION FOR IT HE WOULD SAY IT IS JUSTICE ITSELF
WHICHEVER GROUPS OF SENSATIONS WITHIN A SOUL AWAKEN MOST READILY BEGIN TO SPEAK AND GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND THESE DECIDE AS TO THE GENERAL ORDER OF RANK OF ITS VALUES AND DETERMINE ULTIMATELY ITS LIST OF DESIRABLE THINGS
AND TO CHOOSE FOR COMPANY THAT ROGUISH AND CHEERFUL VICE POLITENESS
DANGER IS AGAIN PRESENT THE MOTHER OF MORALITY GREAT DANGER THIS TIME SHIFTED INTO THE INDIVIDUAL INTO THE NEIGHBOUR AND FRIEND INTO THE STREET INTO THEIR OWN CHILD INTO THEIR OWN HEART INTO ALL THE MOST PERSONAL AND SECRET RECESSES OF THEIR DESIRES AND VOLITIONS
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERYWHERE THE DESIGNATIONS OF MORAL VALUE WERE AT FIRST APPLIED TO MEN AND WERE ONLY DERIVATIVELY AND AT A LATER PERIOD APPLIED TO ACTIONS IT IS A GROSS MISTAKE THEREFORE WHEN HISTORIANS OF MORALS START WITH QUESTIONS LIKE WHY HAVE SYMPATHETIC ACTIONS BEEN PRAISED
ONE BLANKET WILL BE ENOUGH TO CARRY OR YOU MAY FOREGO THE PLEASURE AND BURDEN ALTOGETHER AS WOOD FOR FIRES IS EVERYWHERE ABUNDANT
THE BIG MEADOWS LIE NEAR THE FOOT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE A BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS BASIN SET IN THE HEART OF THE RICHLY FORESTED MOUNTAINS SCARCELY SURPASSED IN THE GRANDEUR OF ITS SURROUNDINGS BY TAHOE
A THOUSAND THOUSAND VOICES ARE HEARD BUT SO FINELY BLENDED THEY SEEM A PART OF THE NIGHT ITSELF AND MAKE A DEEPER SILENCE
THEN FELL THE GLOAMING MAKING EVERYTHING STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS
AT SUCH TIME ITS HEIGHT SEEMS MUCH LESS AS IF CROUCHING AND WEARY IT WERE TAKING REST
THEY ARE BROAD RUGGED CREVASSED CLOUDLIKE MASSES OF DOWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING IN SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVERLIKE GO WINDING DOWN THE VALLEYS THROUGH THE FORESTS TO THE SEA
WHILE TRAVELING WITH A COMPANY OF HUNTERS I SAW ABOUT FIFTY IN ONE FLOCK
LARGE FLOCKS DWELL HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WINTER AND SUMMER DESCENDING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE ADJACENT SAGE PLAINS AND LAVA BEDS TO FEED BUT EVER READY TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE JAGGED CRAGS OF THEIR MOUNTAIN AT EVERY ALARM
THE DUCKS LESS WARY KEPT THEIR PLACES MERELY SWIMMING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND RAISING SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE
YET STRANGE TO SAY THERE ARE DAYS EVEN HERE SOMEWHAT DULL LOOKING WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SEEMS UNCOMMUNICATIVE SENDING OUT NO APPRECIABLE INVITATION AS IF NOT AT HOME
BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOODS ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD THE EYE
THEN THE SHINING OF THE WET LEAVES IS DELIGHTFUL AND THE STEAMY FRAGRANCE AND THE BURST OF BIRD SONG FROM A MULTITUDE OF THRUSHES AND FINCHES AND WARBLERS THAT HAVE NESTS IN THE CHAPARRAL
THE GREAT WILDS OF OUR COUNTRY ONCE HELD TO BE BOUNDLESS AND INEXHAUSTIBLE ARE BEING RAPIDLY INVADED AND OVERRUN IN EVERY DIRECTION AND EVERYTHING DESTRUCTIBLE IN THEM IS BEING DESTROYED
BUT IT IS FAR BETTER TO GO AFOOT
MOST OF THE DRAINAGE OF THE GLACIER VANISHES AT ONCE IN THE POROUS ROCKS TO REAPPEAR IN SPRINGS IN THE DISTANT VALLEY AND IT IS ONLY IN TIME OF FLOOD THAT THE CHANNEL CARRIES MUCH WATER THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL FINE FALLS IN THE GORGE SIX HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT
SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEM SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT RIVER THEN YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT
MOUNT BREMER IS THE MOST NOTED STRONGHOLD OF THE SHEEP IN THE WHOLE SHASTA REGION
GO QUIETLY ALONE NO HARM WILL BEFALL YOU
THE ASCENT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE IS AN EASY WALK AND THE VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT ARE EXTREMELY TELLING
IN APPROACHING IT ITS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING YELLOW SPOTTED HOOD AND WATCHFUL ATTITUDE WILL BE LIKELY TO MAKE YOU GO CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE BOG WHERE IT STANDS AS IF YOU WERE APPROACHING A DANGEROUS SNAKE
TRACING RIVERS TO THEIR FOUNTAINS MAKES THE MOST CHARMING OF TRAVELS
ASPLENIUM EPILOBIUM HEUCHERA HAZEL DOGWOOD AND ALDER MAKE A LUXURIOUS FRINGE AND SETTING AND THE FORESTS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE ALONG THE BANKS ARE THE FINEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE SIERRA
IN SETTING OUT FROM STRAWBERRY VALLEY BY BEARING OFF TO THE NORTHWESTWARD A FEW MILES YOU MAY SEE
THE LOFTY ICY SHASTA TOWERING HIGH ABOVE ALL SEEMS BUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM YOU THOUGH THE DISTANCE IN AN AIR LINE IS ABOUT SIXTY MILES
PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERY BODY SHOULD BE KIND AT LEAST TO HIMSELF
HERE YOU STRIKE THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD WHICH LEADS OVER THE LOW DIVIDE TO THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN
THUS THE SHASTA RIVER ISSUES FROM A LARGE LAKE LIKE SPRING IN SHASTA VALLEY AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE VOLUME OF THE MC CLOUD GUSHES FORTH IN A GRAND SPRING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN A FEW MILES BACK FROM ITS IMMEDIATE BASE
THE LONG GRAY SLOPES LEADING UP TO THE GLACIER SEEM REMARKABLY SMOOTH AND UNBROKEN
REGAINING THE LOW GROUND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HOLDING ON IN YOUR GRAND ORBIT YOU PASS THROUGH A BELT OF JUNIPER WOODS CALLED THE CEDARS TO SHEEP ROCK AT THE FOOT OF THE SHASTA PASS
THE VIVID GREEN OF THE BOULDERS BENEATH THE WATER IS VERY STRIKING AND COLORS THE ENTIRE STREAM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORTIONS BROKEN INTO FOAM
IT IS THREE OR FOUR MILES LONG AND TERMINATES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN MORAINE SPRINKLED ICE CLIFFS SIXTY FEET HIGH
AS THE LIFE BLOOD OF THE LANDSCAPES THE BEST OF THE WILDERNESS COMES TO THEIR BANKS AND NOT ONE DULL PASSAGE IS FOUND IN ALL THEIR EVENTFUL HISTORIES
ARCTIC BEAUTY AND DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ALL MAY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLIMBERS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING AROUND ITS WARM FERTILE BASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS
SHASTA RAMBLES AND MODOC MEMORIES
TRACING THE MC CLOUD TO ITS HIGHEST SPRINGS AND OVER THE DIVIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF FALL RIVER NEAR FORT CROOK THENCE DOWN THAT RIVER TO ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT ON FROM THERE TO THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTTE THROUGH THE BIG MEADOWS AMONG THE SOURCES OF THE FEATHER RIVER AND DOWN THROUGH FORESTS OF SUGAR PINE TO THE FERTILE PLAINS OF CHICO THIS IS A GLORIOUS SAUNTER AND IMPOSES NO HARDSHIP
IT IS LINED WITH EMERALD ALGAE AND MOSSES AND SHADED WITH ALDER WILLOW AND THORN BUSHES WHICH GIVE IT A FINE SETTING
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YOU MAY HEAR THE ROAR OF THE WATER RUSHING FROM THE ROCK AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OR EVEN MORE OR YOU MAY NOT HEAR IT UNTIL WITHIN A FEW RODS
TRACING THIS WILD CHANGING CHANNEL GORGE GULLY OR CANYON THE SECTIONS WILL SHOW MOUNT SHASTA AS A HUGE PALIMPSEST CONTAINING THE RECORDS LAYER UPON LAYER OF STRANGELY CONTRASTED EVENTS IN ITS FIERY ICY HISTORY
SLIGHT RAINSTORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A TRIP ROUND THE MOUNTAIN BUT ONE MAY EASILY FIND SHELTER BENEATH WELL THATCHED TREES THAT SHED THE RAIN LIKE A ROOF
EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLED AND HARRIED
THUS ONE SAUNTERS ON AND ON IN THE GLORIOUS RADIANCE IN UTTER PEACE AND FORGETFULNESS OF TIME
THEIR LONG MASSIVE EARS GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE
TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRONGHOLD OF THE MODOCS HELD BY THEM SO LONG AND DEFIANTLY AGAINST ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK
THEN DARKNESS LIKE DEATH
THE MULE DEER ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY
ONLY A LITTLE FOOD WILL BE REQUIRED
EVERY CRYSTAL DANCES RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCHES OF THE SUN AND CURRENTS OF SAP IN THE GROWING CELLS OF ALL THE VEGETATION ARE EVER IN A VITAL WHIRL AND RUSH AND THOUGH MANY FEET AND WINGS ARE FOLDED HOW MANY ARE ASTIR
BECAUSE HE TALKED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PECULIAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WORN DULL FROM CONSTANT USE
HE GAVE THANKS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAYED FOR THE POOR AND DESTITUTE IN GREAT CITIES WHERE THE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE WAS HARDER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
AT ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK A VISITOR APPEARED MISTER SHIMERDA WEARING HIS RABBIT SKIN CAP AND COLLAR AND NEW MITTENS HIS WIFE HAD KNITTED
HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE DINING ROOM
HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WEARINESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF SICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL RELIEF FROM PAIN
HE SAT STILL AND PASSIVE HIS HEAD RESTING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR HIS HANDS RELAXED UPON THE ARMS
MORNING PRAYERS WERE LONGER THAN USUAL
GRANDFATHER CAME DOWN WEARING A WHITE SHIRT AND HIS SUNDAY COAT
WHEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HATCHET SLUNG TO HIS BELT AND HE GAVE GRANDMOTHER A MEANING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLANNING A SURPRISE FOR ME
FROM UNDER THE LINING HE NOW PRODUCED A COLLECTION OF BRILLIANTLY COLORED PAPER FIGURES SEVERAL INCHES HIGH AND STIFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRESH SMELLING LITTLE TREE IN A CORNER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRISTMAS EVE
ON THE WHITE PAGES I GROUPED SUNDAY SCHOOL CARDS AND ADVERTISING CARDS WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
SHE CUT SQUARES OF COTTON CLOTH AND WE SEWED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK
I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICTURE BOOKS FOR YULKA AND ANTONIA EVEN YULKA WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW
ANYWAY HE WOULD NEVER ALLOW ONE OF HIS HORSES TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRAIN
THEY SAT ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUNDAY GREASING THEIR BOOTS MENDING THEIR SUSPENDERS PLAITING WHIPLASHES
HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ME IN VIRGINIA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HOW MUCH I LIKED THEM
I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACTLY AS THEY LOOKED WORKING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LAMPLIGHT JAKE WITH HIS HEAVY FEATURES SO RUDELY MOULDED THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOMEHOW UNFINISHED OTTO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SAVAGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UPPER LIP CURL SO FEROCIOUSLY UNDER HIS TWISTED MUSTACHE
I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET JAKE
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAMINING OUR CARPETS AND CURTAINS AND FURNITURE ALL THE WHILE COMMENTING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN ENVIOUS COMPLAINING TONE
THE WEEK FOLLOWING CHRISTMAS BROUGHT IN A THAW AND BY NEW YEAR'S DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BROTH OF GRAY SLUSH AND THE GUTTERED SLOPE BETWEEN THE WINDMILL AND THE BARN WAS RUNNING BLACK WATER
YOU'VE GOT A BIRTHDAY PRESENT THIS TIME JIM AND NO MISTAKE
THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BOISTEROUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME CALLING
BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOWS WHAT TRAITS POVERTY MIGHT BRING OUT IN EM
FOR AMBROSCH MY MAMA COME HERE
YOUR MAMA I SAID ANGRILY WANTS OTHER PEOPLE'S THINGS
WISHING HIM SAID MARY IN A TONE OF INQUIRY
SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFTLY THERE SAT MISSUS WILSON IN THE OLD ROCKING CHAIR WITH ONE SICK DEATH LIKE BOY LYING ON HER KNEE CRYING WITHOUT LET OR PAUSE BUT SOFTLY GENTLY AS FEARING TO DISTURB THE TROUBLED GASPING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD ALICE LET HER FAST DROPPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TWIN WHICH SHE WAS LAYING OUT ON A BOARD PLACED ON A SORT OF SOFA SETTEE IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
BUT WILL HE THANK ME FOR IT
BUT THE BEST OF HER PLANS THE HOLIEST THAT WHICH IN SOME MEASURE REDEEMED THE VANITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE RELATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPPRESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DISHEARTENED GLOOMY PERSON
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KEEN PRACTICAL SHREWDNESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTRASTED VERY BEWITCHINGLY WITH THE SIMPLE FOOLISH UNWORLDLY IDEAS SHE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE ROMANCES WHICH MISS SIMMONDS YOUNG LADIES WERE IN THE HABIT OF RECOMMENDING TO EACH OTHER YES
OVER THE CHILD WHICH YET BREATHED THE FATHER BENT WATCHING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE
THEN THE MOTHER LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND WEPT
MARY I ALMOST LOATHE MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MINUTE WHEN MY BROTHERS LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT'S PAST AND GONE AND MARY AS SHE TRIED TO RELEASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BLESSED
BUT HE STAYED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS STURDY FRAME SHOOK WITH HIS STRONG AGONY
HOW INFINITE THE WEALTH OF LOVE AND HOPE GARNERED IN THESE SAME TINY TREASURE HOUSES AND OH
WHAT BANKRUPTS IN THE WORLD WE FEEL WHEN DEATH LIKE SOME REMORSELESS CREDITOR SEIZES ON ALL WE FONDLY THOUGHT OUR OWN THE TWINS
OH JEM DON'T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU
HE REMAINED UP STAIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DAWN SHOWED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DESERTED AND QUIET STREETS TO TRY AND GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR
HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEARING TO DESTROY BY SOUND OR MOTION THE HAPPINESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HAND'S TOUCH THRILLED THROUGH HIS FRAME AND HER SILVERY VOICE WAS WHISPERING TENDERNESS IN HIS EAR
SO LEAVING KIND MESSAGES TO GEORGE AND JANE WILSON AND HESITATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DARE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JEM AND DECIDING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEPPED OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRESH A CONTRAST TO THE DARKENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
THE GHOUL LIKE FEVER WAS NOT TO BE BRAVED WITH IMPUNITY AND BAULKED OF ITS PREY
THEN ALICE BROKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING
AFORE CHRISTMAS TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FULL COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD AND ALL YO HAN HEARD HOW I'VE WISHED IT THIS TERRIBLE LONG TIME
THE BOARD NOT SO FORMIDABLE AS SHE HAD IMAGINED HAD INQUIRED INTO HER CASE AND INSTEAD OF SENDING HER TO STOKE CLAYPOLE HER HUSBAND'S BUCKINGHAMSHIRE PARISH AS SHE HAD DREADED HAD AGREED TO PAY HER RENT
HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JEM'S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE TALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISHED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAINLY
DON'T JEM PLEASE DON'T WHISPERED SHE AGAIN BELIEVING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GRIEF
MARGARET MET JEM WILSON SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHERS WERE SERIOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME
HER CRIES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS ACHING HEART TO COMFORT HERS
THE OLD LEAVEN INFUSED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNT ESTHER FERMENTED IN HER LITTLE BOSOM AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE
IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THINK YOU
I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSSESSES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANTING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE'S DOWNCAST AND THAT I MUST GO MEDDLING WI HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNT'S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM
I THINK I CANNOT GO RIGHT FOR I EITHER CHECK MYSELF TILL I'M DOWNRIGHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT'S TOO KIND AND TENDER BY HALF
BUT EARNEST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCHING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EARS FOR ALL THAT CONCERNED THE DEAD AND SPRANG GENTLY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD COUCH IN HIS ARMS WITH TENDER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UPSTAIRS AS IF AFRAID OF WAKENING HIM
IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SCOLDED BY MISS SIMMONDS TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRIVE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CARRIAGE TO ORDER HER GOWNS FROM THE HASTY TEMPERED YET KIND DRESSMAKER
MARY AND ALICE DREW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SORROW FOR SOME TIME
SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LATCH OF THE WILSONS DOOR TO STILL HER BEATING HEART AND LISTENED TO THE HUSHED QUIET WITHIN
HE'S A TROUBLE CURER NOT A TROUBLEMAKER EXCEPT FOR HIMSELF
THE PONY DID MOST OF IT ADMITTED THE LAD I JUST GAVE HIM HIS HEAD AND THAT'S ALL THERE WAS TO IT
STACY BROWN PROVED THE ONLY GRUMBLER IN THE LOT DECLARING THAT HE COULD NOT SLEEP A WINK ON SUCH A BED AS THAT
WHO IS THE WRANGLER THIS MORNING ASKED THE FOREMAN GLANCING ABOUT AT HIS MEN
HUMPH GRUNTED CURLEY ADAMS
THE COWBOY DID THIS VERY THING BUT WITHIN AN HOUR HE FOUND HIMSELF ALONE THE OTHERS HAVING TURNED IN ONE BY ONE
A WRANGLER'S A WRANGLER ANSWERED BIG FOOT STOLIDLY
THE HORSES OF THE OUTFIT SAVE THOSE THAT WERE ON NIGHT DUTY AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS THAT HAD DEVELOPED A HABIT OF STRAYING HAD BEEN TURNED LOOSE EARLY IN THE EVENING FOR ANIMALS ON THE TRAIL ARE SELDOM STAKED DOWN
WALTER HAD GONE OUT WITH THE SECOND GUARD AND THE OTHERS HAD GATHERED AROUND THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR NIGHTLY STORY TELLING
PONG TELL THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU IF YOU WERE TO SERVE BAD MEALS TO THIS OUTFIT OF COWPUNCHERS
ALMOST BEFORE THE ECHOES OF HIS VOICE HAD DIED AWAY A SHRILL VOICE PIPED UP FROM THE TAIL END OF THE CHUCK WAGON
HI THERE HISSED LUMPY FILLED WITH INDIGNATION THAT ANYONE SHOULD ATTEMPT TO MOUNT A PONY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE
NOT ON THE RANGE WHY NOT DEMANDED THE BOY
IN SPITE OF THEIR HARD COUCHES THE PONY RIDERS SLEPT SOUNDLY EVEN PROFESSOR ZEPPLIN HIMSELF NEVER WAKING THE WHOLE NIGHT THROUGH
STACY GRUMBLED TURNED OVER AND WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN
A LOUD LAUGH FOLLOWED AT CHUNKY'S EXPENSE
STACY BROWN'S LEFT LEG SWUNG OVER THE SADDLE
GRUB PI LE GRUB PI LE
WHERE ARE THEY ASKED THE BOY
YOU WON'T BE SO FAST TO WAKE UP HARD WORKING COWBOYS AFTER THAT I RECKON
CHAPTER FOUR THE FIRST NIGHT IN CAMP
EVEN IF I CAN'T SING I CAN BEAT THAT
LUMPY BATES CAME RUNNING TOWARD HIM NOT DARING TO CALL OUT FOR FEAR OF WAKING THE CAMP
KEEP A GOING AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL RUN PLUMB INTO THEM WAS THE JEERING ANSWER AS THE SLEEPY COWMEN SPURRED THEIR PONIES ON TOWARD CAMP MUTTERING THEIR DISAPPROVAL OF TAKING ALONG A BUNCH OF BOYS ON A CATTLE DRIVE
THE LADS FOUND THAT A PAIR OF BLANKETS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THEM WITH AN ORDINARY WAGON SHEET DOUBLED FOR A TARPAULIN
NONE OF YOU WILL BE FIT FOR DUTY TO MORROW
HE'S A FELLOW WHO'S ALL THE TIME MAKING TROUBLE ISN'T HE ASKED STACY INNOCENTLY
HOW ASKED TAD
WE HAD BETTER START THE DRIVE THIS MORNING
OH NO THIS KIND OF A WRANGLER ISN'T LAUGHED THE FOREMAN
WE'VE GOT A HARD DRIVE BEFORE US AND EVERY MAN MUST BE FIT AS A FIDDLE
THESE THEY SPREAD OUT ON THE GROUND USING BOOTS WRAPPED IN COATS FOR PILLOWS
SHALL WE HAUL UP ASKED LIGE MAKING A MEGAPHONE OF HIS HANDS YES HAUL AWAY
I PROTEST SHOUTED THE PROFESSOR
HE TILTED HIS HEAD TO LOOK UP
I COULD NOT THINK OF ALLOWING ANY OF MY CHARGES TO TAKE SO TERRIBLE A RISK AND
AND THAT TUMBLE'S ENOUGH TO KNOCK THE SENSE OUT OF A FULL GROWN MAN
ARE YOU READY YES
MASTER TAD IS RIGHT DECIDED THE GUIDE GAZING AT THE TWO BOYS APPROVINGLY
MEBBY YOU THINK HE'S HAVING SOME SORT OF A PICNIC DOWN THERE EH GLARED LIGE
CAUTIOUSLY PLACING A HAND AGAINST THE ROCKS TO STEADY HIMSELF TAD WISELY CONCLUDED THAT HEREAFTER IT WOULD NOT PAY TO BE TOO CURIOUS
DON'T MOVE AROUND LIE PERFECTLY STILL WARNED THE GUIDE ARE YOU HURT
BUT FROM THE CAUTIOUS MOVEMENTS OF THE LIGHT FAR BELOW THEM THE GUIDE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LAD WAS AT WORK CARRYING OUT HIS PART OF THE TASK OF RESCUE TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY
I SEE HIM CALLED TAD HIS VOICE SOUNDING HOLLOW AND UNNATURAL TO THOSE ABOVE
LIGE QUICKLY MADE FAST THE LINE TO A TREE
LIGE LEANING OVER THE BRINK WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW THE BOY'S MOVEMENTS BY THE AID OF THE THIN ARC OF LIGHT MADE BY THE TORCH IN TAD'S HAND
YES AGREED TAD THAT DOES LOOK LIKE BUSHES
THE MOVEMENT SENT HIS BODY SWAYING GIDDILY FROM SIDE TO SIDE
LOOKS LIKE A CLUMP OF BUSHES DOWN THERE BUT I AIN'T SURE CAN YOU MAKE IT OUT
AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO THEM HOURS A SHARP CALL FROM THE DEPTHS REACHED THEIR EARS
LODGED IN THE BRANCHES OF A PINYON TREE I THINK IT IS BUT HE DOESN'T ANSWER ME
HE'S SO FAR TO THE RIGHT OF ME THAT I CAN'T REACH HIM
SLOWLY BUT STEADILY THE SLENDER LINE WAS PAID OUT AMID A TENSE SILENCE ON THE PART OF THE LITTLE GROUP AT THE TOP OF THE CANYOU
YOU'LL ALL BE OVER IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CARE
NOR WAS HIS SENSE OF SECURITY INCREASED WHEN IN SHIFTING HIS POSITION THE TORCH FELL FROM HIS GRASP THE FAGOTS SCATTERING AS THEY SLIPPED DOWN BETWEEN THE LIMBS OF THE TREE AND WHIRLING IN EVER DIMINISHING CIRCLES UNTIL FINALLY HE HEARD THEM CLATTER ON THE ROCKS BELOW
I AM THE ONE TO GO AFTER WALT IF ANYONE HAS TO I'LL GO DOWN MISTER THOMAS
BE SURE TO FASTEN HIM SECURELY TO THE LOOP BEFORE YOU GIVE THE SIGNAL TO HAUL UP WARNED THE GUIDE
YOU'D HAVE BOTH OF US AT THE BOTTOM IF I LEFT IT TO YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THIS END
NO I AM THE LIGHTER OF THE TWO URGED TAD
SURE THING ANSWERED THE BOY
AS A RESULT INSTEAD OF STOPPING WHEN HE REACHED THE HAT THE BOY KEPT ON GOING
GALLOPING INTO CAMP THE BOY FETCHED HIS SOMBRERO WHICH HE CARRIED WELL OUT INTO THE FIELD AND TOSSED AWAY
A TEMPORARY CAMP WAS QUICKLY PITCHED
WE DID NOT IT MUST HAVE COME TO LIFE SOME TIME DURING THE NIGHT AND DUG ITS WAY OUT LAUGHED TAD
AS YET THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO ATTEMPT ANY FANCY RIDING WITH THEIR PONIES OWING TO THE RUGGED NATURE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN JOURNEYING
SUPPER HAVING BEEN FINISHED THE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT THE CAMP FIRE FOR THEIR EVENING CHAT AFTER WHICH ADMONISHING STACY TO KEEP WITHIN HIS TENT AND NOT TO GO BORROWING TROUBLE THE BOYS TURNED IN FOR A SOUND SLEEP
COLD WATER IS THE MOST NOURISHING THING WE'VE TOUCHED SINCE LAST NIGHT
AN EARLY START WAS MADE SO THAT THE PARTY REACHED THE PROMISED TABLE LANDS SHORTLY BEFORE TEN O'CLOCK IN THE FORENOON
ALL AGREED THAT TAD'S SUPERIOR HORSEMANSHIP ALONE HAD WON THE RACE FOR HIM
AT THE MOMENT WHEN HE FREED HIS LEFT FOOT FROM THE STIRRUP HE THREW HIS BODY SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT REACHING FOR THE HAT WITHOUT TAKING THE PRECAUTION TO GRASP THE POMMEL
THE FIRST TIME HE RODE SWIFTLY BY IT LEANING OVER TO LOOK AT THE HAT AS HE PASSED HOLDING TO THE POMMEL FIRMLY WITH HIS LEFT HAND
JAM EXCLAIMED CHUNKY STRETCHING HIS NECK AND EYEING THE DISH LONGINGLY
BUT I KNOW AN OLD SETTLER WHO WILL LEND US HIS DOG IF IT IS NOT OUT
ONCE MORE STACY APPROACHED THE SOMBRERO HIS PONY RUNNING WELL AND AS HE DREW NEAR IT THEY SAW HIM RISE IN HIS SADDLE JUST AS TAD BUTLER HAD DONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE
GRASPING THE POMMEL WITH THE LEFT HAND HE APPEARED TO DIVE HEAD FIRST TOWARD THE GROUND
PRESIDENT BROWN I WITHDRAW MY CRITICISM I OFFER YOU MY HUMBLE APOLOGIES
HE BURIED HIS BISCUIT UNDER A LAYER OF JAM OVER WHICH HE SPREAD A THICK COATING OF HONEY
THEN BIDDING THE BOYS RIDE UP NEAR THE SPOT TO WATCH HIM HE DREW OFF SOME TEN RODS AND WHEELING SPURRED HIS PONY TO A RUN
WHY DON'T YOU MOVE THE PONY
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT FILLED THE BOYS WITH EXCITEMENT
AND WE'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU ANNOUNCED STACY SWELLING WITH PRIDE
TAD IS AN EXPERIENCED RIDER
YES THE COUNTRY IS FULL OF CAVES
I AM FREE TO ADMIT THAT I AM HUNGRY TOO
THE BOYS HOWLED WITH DELIGHT THAT IS ALL DID SAVE STACY BROWN
HAT TOO CLOSE TO ME I COULDN'T GET IT EXPLAINED CHUNKY THE BOYS ROARED
WHAT'S THAT FOR DEMANDED NED WONDERINGLY
THEY SAW HIS LONG HAIR ALMOST BRUSH THE GRASS ONE OF HIS HANDS SWEPT DOWN AND UP AND ONCE MORE TAD BUTLER ROSE STANDING IN HIS STIRRUPS UTTERING A COWBOY YELL AS HE WAVED THE SOMBRERO ON HIGH
NOW FALL TO YOUNG GENTLEMEN DIRECTED THE PROFESSOR
I RECKON THERE ARE SMILED THE GUIDE WE ARE IN THE BEAR COUNTRY NOW
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL RACE THE LITTLE INDIAN PONIES SEEMING TO ENTER THOROUGHLY INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CONTEST STRETCHING THEMSELVES OUT TO THEIR FULL LENGTHS AND WITH HEADS ON A LEVEL WITH THEIR BACKS FAIRLY FLEW ACROSS THE GREAT PLOT OF GREEN
THE LITTLE ANIMALS WERE BECOMING MORE SURE FOOTED EVERY DAY AND NED SAID THAT BEFORE THE TRIP WAS FINISHED JIMMIE WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK A SLACK ROPE
WITH A SHOUT THE BOYS DASHED PELL MELL TO MEET THE PACK TRAIN AND FALLING IN BEHIND THE SLOW MOVING BURROS URGED THEM ON WITH DERISIVE SHOUTS AND SUNDRY RESOUNDING SLAPS ON THE ANIMALS FLANKS
HE NO DOUBT WOULD BRING FOOD OF SOME KIND WITH HIM
THE BOYS WERE NOW ALL ANXIETY TO START WHILE THE PONIES AFTER THEIR SUNDAY REST WERE ALMOST AS FULL OF LIFE AS WERE THEIR OWNERS
THE GREAT GREEN FIELD SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY TALL TREES MADE THE PLACE AN IDEAL ONE FOR THEIR PURPOSE
WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE DEAD WHAT A QUESTION
THE DAILY NEWSCASTS FROM TERRA SHOWED A CORRESPONDING SHIFT IN INTEREST AT HOME
MASS SUICIDE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS NOTICE WHAT'S IN THE CORNERS
A FLOODLIGHT WAS ON IN THE ROOM INSIDE AND LATTIMER WAS GOING AROUND LOOKING AT THINGS WHILE A SPACE FORCE OFFICER STOOD BY THE DOOR
THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPECIES OF WHAT MIGHT LOOSELY BE CALLED BIRDS AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EASILY BE CLASSED AS A REPTILE AND A CARNIVOROUS MAMMAL THE SIZE OF A CAT WITH BIRDLIKE CLAWS AND A HERBIVORE ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH THE PIGLIKE THING IN THE BIG DARFHULVA MURAL AND ANOTHER LIKE A GAZELLE WITH A SINGLE HORN IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD
GLORIA STANDISH WHO HAD DROPPED IN FOR LUNCH WAS ON THE MEZZANINE FAIRLY SCREAMING INTO A RADIOPHONE EXTENSION DOZEN AND A HALF OF THEM
THE CIVILIAN SPECIALISTS IN OTHER FIELDS AND THE SPACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLDING TAPE LINES AND MAKING SKETCHES AND SNAPPING CAMERAS WERE ALL FLYING TO LOWER SYRTIS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH OXYGEN THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT SUPPORTED
SO THEY JUST CAME IN HERE AND LIT THE CHARCOAL AND SAT DRINKING TOGETHER TILL THEY ALL FELL ASLEEP
NOT THAT I'M INTERESTED IN ALL THIS FOR MYSELF HE DISCLAIMED AFTER LISTENING TO THE TELECAST FROM TERRA TWO DAYS AFTER HIS DISCOVERY
THE ORGANIZATION OF A SOCIETY OF MARTIAN ARCHAEOLOGY WITH ANTHONY LATTIMER PH D THE LOGICAL CANDIDATE FOR THE CHAIR
LECTURES
WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORY
YES CHARCOAL
THAT TOOK THE CENTER OF INTEREST AWAY FROM ARCHAEOLOGY AND STARTED A NEW BURST OF ACTIVITY
TONY LATTIMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATION WITH SID HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECAST OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET
BILL CHANDLER THE ZOOLOGIST HAD BEEN GOING DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE OLD SEA BOTTOM OF SYRTIS
SO I BELIEVE I SHALL GO BACK AT LEAST FOR A WHILE AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO
BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION DRAMATIZE IT
THEY ALSO FOUND A MARTIAN CALENDAR THE YEAR HAD BEEN DIVIDED INTO TEN MORE OR LESS EQUAL MONTHS AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DOMA
THE TERRAN PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF LIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND A ROOM FULL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST THING
NOW IT WAS BURNED AWAY AT BOTH SIDES AND LAY STILL HOT ALONG THE EDGES ON THE FLOOR OF THE BIG OFFICE ROOM IN FRONT
IT WAS LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE AND WE HAD TO BURN IT DOWN WITH A TORCH THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE
TONY'S FOUND THE MARTIANS
MARTHA REMEMBERED THE CLOSED DOOR ON THE FIRST SURVEY THEY HADN'T ATTEMPTED OPENING IT
ON THE DAIS UNDER THE GOLDEN DOME THE KING CRIED OUT AGAIN RACKED BY AWFUL PAROXYSMS
SINCE HIS BIRTH HE HAS BEEN GUARDED SO CLOSELY THAT THE CLEVEREST POISONERS OF THE EAST COULD NOT REACH HIM
YOU HAVE NEVER DISOBEYED ME OBEY MY LAST COMMAND
I KNOW NOW WHAT BRINGS ME TO THE PYRE
THERE THEY STROVE TO BREAK THE SILVER CORD OF LIFE AND THRUST MY SOUL INTO THE BODY OF A FOUL NIGHT WEIRD THEIR SORCERY SUMMONED UP FROM HELL AH
SEND MY SOUL CLEAN TO ASURA
AS YOU WELL KNOW THERE ARE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOLE DUTY IS TO TASTE HIS FOOD AND WINE AND FIFTY ARMED WARRIORS GUARD HIS CHAMBER AS THEY GUARD IT NOW
THEY SEEK TO SNAP THE SILVER CORD THAT BINDS ME TO MY DYING BODY
WITH A LONG STAINED FINGERNAIL HE MAPPED THE CONSTELLATIONS ON THE MARBLE TILED FLOOR
BUT AT THE URGENT ENTREATY OF THE PRINCESS OF KHOSALA WHO LOVED BHUNDA CHAND VAINLY HE GAVE HER A LOCK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TOKEN OF REMEMBRANCE
A LOW CONFUSED MOAN WANED FROM HIS MOUTH
THE MAN SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND TURNED BACK INTO THE ARABESQUE CHAMBER
BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAWN FROM ITS BODY AND ACROSS GULFS OF ECHOING SPACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE MAT
THE SLANT OF THE MOON PRESAGED EVIL FOR THE KING OF VENDHYA THE STARS ARE IN TURMOIL THE SERPENT IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELEPHANT
THIS MAN WAS CLAD IN A BROWN CAMEL HAIR ROBE AND SANDALS AND A GREEN TURBAN WAS ON HIS HEAD
POINT OF CONTACT INQUIRED THE OTHER
ALL DISCARDED PORTIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY STILL REMAIN PART OF IT ATTACHED TO IT BY INTANGIBLE CONNECTIONS
NOT UNTIL THE HEAVENS WERE IN THE PROPER ORDER COULD THEY PERFORM THIS NECROMANCY
HE WAS YOUNG NO SPEAR HAD TOUCHED HIM NO POISON LURKED IN HIS WINE
THEY CLUSTER AROUND ME THEIR HANDS ARE TALONED THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE FLAME BURNING IN DARKNESS
YOUR CRY AND THE GRIP OF YOUR FINGERS BROUGHT ME BACK BUT I AM GOING FAST
THERE WAS THE OLD IMPERIOUS NOTE IN HIS FAILING WHISPER
THEIR FINGERS SEAR ME LIKE FIRE
I TELL YOU IT IS NOT POISON SHE CRIED
THE TELEPHONE LINE WAS SOON REPAIRED AND A STEADY STREAM OF RESCUE VEHICLES BEGAN ARRIVING FROM HARKNESS FIRE TRUCKS THREE AMBULANCES AND PRIVATE CARS DRIVEN BY VOLUNTEERS
HE'S A GREAT SCIENTIST
LET'S SEE ABOUT GETTING HELP FOR MISTER FABER
ANOTHER ENGINEER RUSHED TOWARD THE DOOR TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING OUTSIDE
THIS ISN'T PART OF YOUR TESTING ROUTINE IS IT
THEY PICKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WRECKAGE AND EMERGED ON A SCENE OF FRIGHTFUL DESTRUCTION
HE SMILED GUILTILY AS HE ADDED BUT I MUST ADMIT I WAS MORE THAN A LITTLE CONCERNED MYSELF
WITHIN MINUTES TOM WAS IN CHARGE OF CLEARING AWAY RUBBLE AND EXTRICATING ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE TRAPPED INSIDE THE BUILDINGS
WE'D BETTER NOT TRY TO MOVE HIM TOM DECIDED WE'LL GET AN AMBULANCE
AN INSTANT LATER IT CRASHED OVER PINNING MARK FABER BENEATH IT
TOM'S EYES FOCUSED IN HORROR ON THE WRECKAGE ENVELOPED BY STILL BILLOWING DUST
MALE OR FEMALE HUMAN OR ANIMAL
TOM NODDED UNHAPPILY
THEN TOM WHO HAD BEEN STUNNED BY SOME FALLING DEBRIS RAISED HIMSELF TO A SITTING POSITION
ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT CASCADED FROM THE WALL SHELVES AND A HEAVY DUTY CHAIN HOIST CAME LOOSE FROM ITS OVERHEAD TRACK PLUNGING TO THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIFYING CRASH
HIS FRIEND'S EYELIDS FLICKERED
FOR MINUTES NO ONE STIRRED AMONG THE WRECKAGE
THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD JUST NOTICED HIS FRIEND LYING PINNED BENEATH A HEAVY BEAM NEARBY
MISTER SWIFT'S EYES TWINKLED
THE SKY WAS VISIBLE THROUGH SEVERAL GAPING HOLES IN THE ROOF WHICH WAS SAGGING DANGEROUSLY ON ITS SUPPORTING TRUSSES
BUD THREW UP HIS ARMS TO PROTECT HIMSELF BUT TOO LATE
MISTER SWIFT CAME INTO THE LIVING ROOM JUST THEN AND TOLD TOM HOW WORRIED MISSUS SWIFT AND SANDY HAD BEEN
INSIDE A SECRET ROCKET TELEMETERING DEVICE WAS MOUNTED ON ITS TEST STAND
ANYHOW WE WANT TO HELP GOT A JOB FOR US
AND THE ONLY TRUCK WE HAD AVAILABLE WAS IN THAT BURNING SHED THE SUPERINTENDENT ADDED BITTERLY
I'LL BE GLAD TO TRY SIR HE REPLIED
THE TWO GIRLS WERE AS MUCH UPSET AS TOM'S MOTHER TOM LAUGHED
THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE ONE I SPEAK OF THE EYES WHICH ARE THE BEGINNING OF LOVE IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF THE MOUTH WHICH IS THE END OF LOVE
AND NOW THAT IT HATH PLEASED HER TO DENY ME THIS LOVE MY MASTER OF HIS GREAT GOODNESS HATH PLACED ALL MY BEATITUDE THERE WHERE MY HOPE WILL NOT FAIL ME
BUT WHEN I STILL SPAKE NOT ONE OF THEM WHO BEFORE HAD BEEN TALKING WITH ANOTHER ADDRESSED ME BY MY NAME SAYING TO WHAT END LOVEST THOU THIS LADY SEEING THAT THOU CANST NOT SUPPORT HER PRESENCE
THIS SECOND PART IS DIVIDED INTO TWO FOR IN THE FIRST I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER SOUL RELATING SOME OF HER VIRTUES PROCEEDING FROM HER SOUL IN THE SECOND I SPEAK OF HER AS REGARDS THE NOBLENESS OF HER BODY NARRATING SOME OF HER BEAUTIES HERE LOVE SAITH CONCERNING HER
IN THE SECOND I TELL WHAT IS UNDERSTOOD OF HER ON EARTH HERE MY LADY IS DESIRED
AND I DECLARE THAT WHEN I SPEAK THEREOF LOVE SHEDS SUCH PERFECT SWEETNESS OVER ME THAT IF MY COURAGE FAILED NOT CERTAINLY TO HIM MY LISTENERS MUST BE ALL RESIGN'D
THE SECOND BEGINS HERE AN ANGEL THE THIRD HERE DEAR SONG I KNOW
SO TO THE ROAD THOU SHALT BE RECONCILED AND FIND THE LADY AND WITH THE LADY LOVE
THEN THOSE LADIES BEGAN TO TALK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AS I HAVE SEEN SNOW FALL AMONG THE RAIN SO WAS THEIR TALK MINGLED WITH SIGHS
IN THE FOURTH REPEATING TO WHOM I PURPOSE SPEAKING I TELL THE REASON WHY I SPEAK TO THEM
TO HER I WEND ALONG IN WHOSE MUCH STRENGTH MY WEAKNESS IS MADE STRONG
IN THE THIRD I SAY WHAT IT IS I PURPOSE TO SPEAK SO AS NOT TO BE IMPEDED BY FAINTHEARTEDNESS
THE FIRST PART IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR
WHATEVER HER SWEET EYES ARE TURNED UPON SPIRITS OF LOVE DO ISSUE THENCE IN FLAME WHICH THROUGH THEIR EYES WHO THEN MAY LOOK ON THEM PIERCE TO THE HEART'S DEEP CHAMBER EVERY ONE
WHICH THING BEING THUS THERE CAME A DAY WHEN CERTAIN LADIES TO WHOM IT WAS WELL KNOWN THEY HAVING BEEN WITH ME AT DIVERS TIMES IN MY TROUBLE WERE MET TOGETHER FOR THE PLEASURE OF GENTLE COMPANY
THEREAFTER THIS SONNET BRED IN ME DESIRE TO WRITE DOWN IN VERSE FOUR OTHER THINGS TOUCHING MY CONDITION THE WHICH THINGS IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I HAD NOT YET MADE MANIFEST
A WORD SHOULD BE SAID HERE OF THE TITLE OF DANTE'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY
ON JANUARY TWENTY FIFTH HE WROTE MANY AND MANY THANKS FOR A MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICE MOST THOROUGHLY PERFORMED
AND IF YOU HAVE TIME IT WOULD BE A GREAT SERVICE TO TRANSLATE THE ANALYSES OF THE POEMS WHICH I OMITTED
THROUGHOUT THE VITA NUOVA THERE IS A STRAIN LIKE THE FIRST FALLING MURMUR WHICH REACHES THE EAR IN SOME REMOTE MEADOW AND PREPARES US TO LOOK UPON THE SEA
THIS BOOK IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM WAS RECEIVED WITH FAVOUR AND SETTLED THE CLAIM OF ROSSETTI TO RANK AS A POETIC TRANSLATOR OR INDEED AS A POET IN HIS OWN RIGHT
HE TRANSLATED AT AN EARLY AGE CHIEFLY BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE AND EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE A GREAT NUMBER OF POEMS BY THE ITALIANS CONTEMPORARY WITH DANTE OR PRECEDING HIM AND AMONG OTHER THINGS HE MADE A VERSION OF THE WHOLE VITA NUOVA PROSE AND VERSE
THE ONLY TRUE MOTIVE FOR PUTTING POETRY INTO A FRESH LANGUAGE MUST BE TO ENDOW A FRESH NATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE WITH ONE MORE POSSESSION OF BEAUTY
THE LIFE BLOOD OF RHYTHMICAL TRANSLATION IS THIS COMMANDMENT THAT A GOOD POEM SHALL NOT BE TURNED INTO A BAD ONE
IT IS THEREFORE AND ON ALL ACCOUNTS UNNECESSARY TO SAY MUCH MORE OF THE WORK HERE THAN IT SAYS FOR ITSELF
OFTEN WOULD HE AVAIL HIMSELF OF ANY SPECIAL GRACE OF HIS OWN IDIOM AND EPOCH IF ONLY HIS WILL BELONGED TO HIM OFTEN WOULD SOME CADENCE SERVE HIM BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S STRUCTURE SOME STRUCTURE BUT FOR HIS AUTHOR'S CADENCE OFTEN THE BEAUTIFUL TURN OF A STANZA MUST BE WEAKENED TO ADOPT SOME RHYME WHICH WILL TALLY AND HE SEES THE POET REVELLING IN ABUNDANCE OF LANGUAGE WHERE HIMSELF IS SCANTILY SUPPLIED
THIS HAS INDUCED SOME EDITORS OF THE VITA NUOVA TO EXPLAIN THE TITLE AS MEANING EARLY LIFE
POETRY NOT BEING AN EXACT SCIENCE LITERALITY OF RENDERING IS ALTOGETHER SECONDARY TO THIS CHIEF LAW
MY NOTES WHICH YOU HAVE TAKEN THE TROUBLE OF REVISING ARE OF COURSE QUITE PALTRY AND USELESS
THESE WILDERING PHANTASIES THEN CARRIED ME TO SEE MY LADY DEAD
THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE SAYING BE NOW THE THIRD HERE THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE
AND IN HIS SPEECH HE LAUGH'D AND LAUGH'D AGAIN THEN WHILE IT WAS HIS PLEASURE TO REMAIN I CHANCED TO LOOK THE WAY HE HAD DRAWN NEAR AND SAW THE LADIES JOAN AND BEATRICE APPROACH ME THIS THE OTHER FOLLOWING ONE AND A SECOND MARVEL INSTANTLY
THEN SAW I MANY BROKEN HINTED SIGHTS IN THE UNCERTAIN STATE I STEPP'D INTO
AND SO STRONG WAS MY PHANTASY THAT I WEPT AGAIN IN VERY TRUTH AND SAID WITH MY TRUE VOICE O EXCELLENT SOUL HOW BLESSED IS HE THAT NOW LOOKETH UPON THEE
AND AT THE FIRST IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I SAW CERTAIN FACES OF WOMEN WITH THEIR HAIR LOOSENED WHICH CALLED OUT TO ME THOU SHALT SURELY DIE AFTER THE WHICH OTHER TERRIBLE AND UNKNOWN APPEARANCES SAID UNTO ME THOU ART DEAD
WHEN BEING AROUSED I OPENED MINE EYES AND KNEW THAT IT HAD BEEN A DECEPTION
WHEREBY OTHER LADIES WHO WERE ABOUT THE ROOM BECOMING AWARE OF MY DISCOMFORT BY REASON OF THE MOAN THAT SHE MADE WHO INDEED WAS OF MY VERY NEAR KINDRED LED HER AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS AND THEN SET THEMSELVES TO AWAKEN ME THINKING THAT I DREAMED AND SAYING SLEEP NO LONGER AND BE NOT DISQUIETED
AND THEREWITHAL SUCH A BEWILDERMENT POSSESS'D ME THAT I SHUT MINE EYES FOR PEACE AND IN MY BRAIN DID CEASE ORDER OF THOUGHT AND EVERY HEALTHFUL THING
THIS LADY'S RIGHT NAME WAS JOAN BUT BECAUSE OF HER COMELINESS OR AT LEAST IT WAS SO IMAGINED SHE WAS CALLED OF MANY PRIMAVERA SPRING AND WENT BY THAT NAME AMONG THEM
THE SECOND PART BEGINS HERE I WAS A THINKING THE FIRST PART DIVIDES INTO TWO
AND MY HUE WAS SUCH THAT THEY LOOK'D AT EACH OTHER AND THOUGHT OF DEATH SAYING UNDER THEIR BREATH MOST TENDERLY O LET US COMFORT HIM THEN UNTO ME WHAT DREAM WAS THINE THAT IT HATH SHAKEN THEE SO MUCH
THIS WORLD'S THICK VAPOURS WHELM YOUR EYES UNWORTHY OF THAT GLORIOUS SHOW BLIND TO HIS SPLENDOUR BENT UPON HIS SHAME
IN FLESH WAS RAIMENTED HOW HE WAS KILLED AND BURIED FROM THE DEAD HOW HE AROSE TO LIFE WITH VICTORY AND REIGNED IN HEAVEN HOW ALL OF US SHALL BE GLORIOUS LIKE HIM WHOSE HEARTS TO HIS ARE WED HOW THEY WHO DIE FOR LOVE OF REASON GIVE HYPOCRITES TYRANTS SOPHISTS ALL WHO SELL THEIR NEIGHBOURS ILL FOR HOLINESS TO HELL HOW THE DEAD SAINT CONDEMNS THE BAD WHO LIVE HOW ALL HE DOES BECOMES A LAW FOR MEN HOW HE AT LAST TO JUDGE SHALL COME AGAIN
ORGAN OF RUT NOT REASON IS THE LORD WHO FROM THE BODY POLITIC DOTH DRAIN LUST FOR HIMSELF INSTEAD OF TOIL AND PAIN LEAVING US LEAN AS CRICKETS ON DRY SWARD
IL POPOLO E UNA BESTIA
THOU LIKE ARCTURUS STEADFAST IN THE SKIES WITH TARDY SENSE GUIDEST THY KINGDOM FAIR BEARING ALONE THE LOAD OF LIBERTY
DUE TO THEE THEIR PRAISE OF MAIDEN PURE OF TEEMING MOTHERHOOD
MONEY IS FALSE AND LIGHT UNLESS IT BE BOUGHT BY A MAN'S OWN WORTHY QUALITIES AND BLOOD IS SUCH THAT ITS CORRUPT DISEASE AND IGNORANT PRETENCE ARE FOUL TO SEE
THAT PENANCE HATH NO BLAME WHICH MAGDALEN FOUND SWEET PURGING OUR SHAME SELF PUNISHMENT IS VIRTUE ALL MEN KNOW
HEAVEN HELP THAT BODY WHICH A LITTLE MIND HOUSED IN A HEAD LACKING EARS TONGUE AND EYES AND SENSELESS BUT FOR SMELL CAN TYRANNISE
MOST WONDERFUL
THE PEOPLE IS A BEAST OF MUDDY BRAIN THAT KNOWS NOT ITS OWN FORCE AND THEREFORE STANDS LOADED WITH WOOD AND STONE THE POWERLESS HANDS OF A MERE CHILD GUIDE IT WITH BIT AND REIN ONE KICK WOULD BE ENOUGH TO BREAK THE CHAIN BUT THE BEAST FEARS AND WHAT THE CHILD DEMANDS IT DOES NOR ITS OWN TERROR UNDERSTANDS CONFUSED AND STUPEFIED BY BUGBEARS VAIN
WELL TOO IF HE LIKE LOVE WOULD FILCH OUR HOARD WITH PLEASURE TO OURSELVES SLUICING OUR VEIN AND VIGOUR TO PERPETUATE THE STRAIN OF LIFE BY SPILTH OF LIFE WITHIN US STORED
QUINCI IMPARA A STUPIRTI
HE LIVES THY LOSS HE DIES FROM EVERY LIMB MANGLED BY THEE LIGHTNINGS OF GODHEAD SHINE FROM WHICH THY DARKNESS HATH NOT WHERE TO HIDE
WHO MAY CONDEMN HIS SUPERSTITION
THE SAVAGE PHILOSOPHER THE DUAL MIND
THE ORIGINAL ATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN TOWARD THE ETERNAL THE GREAT MYSTERY THAT SURROUNDS AND EMBRACES US WAS AS SIMPLE AS IT WAS EXALTED
HERE IS THE SUPREME MYSTERY THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WORSHIP WITHOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE NO RELIGION AND IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS MYSTERY OUR ATTITUDE CANNOT BE VERY UNLIKE THAT OF THE NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WHO BEHOLDS WITH AWE THE DIVINE IN ALL CREATION
IT WAS NOT THEN WHOLLY FROM IGNORANCE OR IMPROVIDENCE THAT HE FAILED TO ESTABLISH PERMANENT TOWNS AND TO DEVELOP A MATERIAL CIVILIZATION
THE FIRST BAMBEDAY OR RELIGIOUS RETREAT MARKED AN EPOCH IN THE LIFE OF THE YOUTH WHICH MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF CONFIRMATION OR CONVERSION IN CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE
KNOWING THAT GOD SETS NO VALUE UPON MATERIAL THINGS HE TOOK WITH HIM NO OFFERINGS OR SACRIFICES OTHER THAN SYMBOLIC OBJECTS SUCH AS PAINTS AND TOBACCO
TO THE UNTUTORED SAGE THE CONCENTRATION OF POPULATION WAS THE PROLIFIC MOTHER OF ALL EVILS MORAL NO LESS THAN PHYSICAL
AT THE SOLEMN HOUR OF SUNRISE OR SUNSET HE TOOK UP HIS POSITION OVERLOOKING THE GLORIES OF EARTH AND FACING THE GREAT MYSTERY AND THERE HE REMAINED NAKED ERECT SILENT AND MOTIONLESS EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS AND FORCES OF HIS ARMING FOR A NIGHT AND A DAY TO TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS BUT RARELY LONGER
AMONG US ALL MEN WERE CREATED SONS OF GOD AND STOOD ERECT AS CONSCIOUS OF THEIR DIVINITY
IN THIS TYPE OF PRAYER THERE WAS NO BESEECHING OF FAVOR OR HELP
FROM THE SUN AS THE UNIVERSAL FATHER PROCEEDS THE QUICKENING PRINCIPLE IN NATURE AND IN THE PATIENT AND FRUITFUL WOMB OF OUR MOTHER THE EARTH ARE HIDDEN EMBRYOS OF PLANTS AND MEN
THAT SOLITARY COMMUNION WITH THE UNSEEN WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST EXPRESSION OF OUR RELIGIOUS LIFE IS PARTLY DESCRIBED IN THE WORD BAMBEDAY LITERALLY MYSTERIOUS FEELING WHICH HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY TRANSLATED FASTING AND DREAMING
WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE CAMP HE MUST REMAIN AT A DISTANCE UNTIL HE HAD AGAIN ENTERED THE VAPOR BATH AND PREPARED HIMSELF FOR INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOWS
IT WAS SILENT BECAUSE ALL SPEECH IS OF NECESSITY FEEBLE AND IMPERFECT THEREFORE THE SOULS OF MY ANCESTORS ASCENDED TO GOD IN WORDLESS ADORATION
THIS IS THE MATERIAL OR PHYSICAL PRAYER
IN HIS OWN THOUGHT HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM HE SCORNED THEM EVEN AS A LOFTY SPIRIT ABSORBED IN ITS STERN TASK REJECTS THE SOFT BEDS THE LUXURIOUS FOOD THE PLEASURE WORSHIPING DALLIANCE OF A RICH NEIGHBOR
THE HISTORIANS OF THE WHITE RACE ADMIT THAT THE INDIAN WAS NEVER THE FIRST TO REPUDIATE HIS OATH
NOTHING OF THE MARVELOUS COULD ASTONISH HIM AS THAT A BEAST SHOULD SPEAK OR THE SUN STAND STILL
NONE MIGHT EXHORT OR CONFESS OR IN ANY WAY MEDDLE WITH THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF ANOTHER
THE FAMILY WAS NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL UNIT BUT ALSO THE UNIT OF GOVERNMENT
HIS DAILY DEVOTIONS WERE MORE NECESSARY TO HIM THAN DAILY FOOD
WHENEVER IN THE COURSE OF THE DAILY HUNT THE RED HUNTER COMES UPON A SCENE THAT IS STRIKINGLY BEAUTIFUL OR SUBLIME A BLACK THUNDERCLOUD WITH THE RAINBOW'S GLOWING ARCH ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN A WHITE WATERFALL IN THE HEART OF A GREEN GORGE A VAST PRAIRIE TINGED WITH THE BLOOD RED OF SUNSET HE PAUSES FOR AN INSTANT IN THE ATTITUDE OF WORSHIP
THE REMOTER DEGREES OF KINSHIP WERE FULLY RECOGNIZED AND THAT NOT AS A MATTER OF FORM ONLY FIRST COUSINS WERE KNOWN AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS THE NAME OF COUSIN CONSTITUTED A BINDING CLAIM AND OUR RIGID MORALITY FORBADE MARRIAGE BETWEEN COUSINS IN ANY KNOWN DEGREE OR IN OTHER WORDS WITHIN THE CLAN
HE HAD NEITHER A NATIONAL ARMY NOR AN ORGANIZED CHURCH
LOVE BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN IS FOUNDED ON THE MATING INSTINCT AND IS NOT FREE FROM DESIRE AND SELF SEEKING
BUT TO HAVE A FRIEND AND TO BE TRUE UNDER ANY AND ALL TRIALS IS THE MARK OF A MAN
HER ATTITUDE AND SECRET MEDITATIONS MUST BE SUCH AS TO INSTILL INTO THE RECEPTIVE SOUL OF THE UNBORN CHILD THE LOVE OF THE GREAT MYSTERY AND A SENSE OF BROTHERHOOD WITH ALL CREATION
THE HOSPITALITY OF THE WIGWAM IS ONLY LIMITED BY THE INSTITUTION OF WAR
THE ORDEAL IS BEST MET ALONE WHERE NO CURIOUS OR PITYING EYES EMBARRASS HER WHERE ALL NATURE SAYS TO HER SPIRIT TIS LOVE TIS LOVE THE FULFILLING OF LIFE
THIS BOND IS BETWEEN MAN AND MAN IS USUALLY FORMED IN EARLY YOUTH AND CAN ONLY BE BROKEN BY DEATH
THIS WILD MOTHER HAS NOT ONLY THE EXPERIENCE OF HER MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND THE ACCEPTED RULES OF HER PEOPLE FOR A GUIDE BUT SHE HUMBLY SEEKS TO LEARN A LESSON FROM ANTS BEES SPIDERS BEAVERS AND BADGERS
OUR HONOR IS THE GUARANTEE FOR HIS SAFETY SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE CAMP
WHEN SHE FELL THE WHOLE RACE FELL WITH HER
WHEN HE BECOMES AN OLD MAN HE LOVES TO MAKE A NOTABLE EFFORT TO PROVE HIS GRATITUDE
IN DUE TIME THE CHILD TAKES OF HIS OWN ACCORD THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER AND SPEAKS REVERENTLY OF THE POWERS
INDEED THE DISTINCTIVE WORK OF BOTH GRANDPARENTS IS THAT OF ACQUAINTING THE YOUTH WITH THE NATIONAL TRADITIONS AND BELIEFS
HE CUTS OFF THE CHOICEST MORSEL OF THE MEAT AND CASTS IT INTO THE FIRE THE PUREST AND MOST ETHEREAL ELEMENT
BEFORE THIS CALAMITY CAME UPON US YOU COULD NOT FIND ANYWHERE A HAPPIER HOME THAN THAT CREATED BY THE INDIAN WOMAN
MANY OF THE INDIANS BELIEVED THAT ONE MAY BE BORN MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CLAIMED TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF A FORMER INCARNATION
AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE YEARS HE SAVED HIS BAND FROM UTTER DESTRUCTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL ENEMIES BY SUDDENLY GIVING WARNING RECEIVED IN A DREAM OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY
THE MEN BLACKEN THEIR FACES AND WIDOWS OR BEREAVED PARENTS SOMETIMES GASH THEIR ARMS AND LEGS TILL THEY ARE COVERED WITH BLOOD
GIVING THEMSELVES UP WHOLLY TO THEIR GRIEF THEY ARE NO LONGER CONCERNED ABOUT ANY EARTHLY POSSESSION AND OFTEN GIVE AWAY ALL THAT THEY HAVE TO THE FIRST COMERS EVEN TO THEIR BEDS AND THEIR HOME
FIVE YEARS LATER HE REPEATED THE SERVICE AND AGAIN SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM AWFUL SLAUGHTER
THERE WAS A WELL KNOWN SIOUX WAR PROPHET WHO LIVED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST CENTURY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBERED BY THE OLD MEN OF HIS BAND
THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS REMARKABLE PROPHECIES
IT WAS PREPARED BY DRESSING IN THE FINEST CLOTHES TOGETHER WITH SOME PERSONAL POSSESSIONS AND ORNAMENTS WRAPPED IN SEVERAL ROBES AND FINALLY IN A SECURE COVERING OF RAW HIDE
AT THE END OF A YEAR FROM THE TIME OF DEATH THE RELATIVES MADE A PUBLIC FEAST AND GAVE AWAY THE CLOTHING AND OTHER GIFTS WHILE THE LOCK OF HAIR WAS INTERRED WITH APPROPRIATE CEREMONIES
IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN HAD SOMEHOW DEVELOPED OCCULT POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THE LATTER DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IMPOSTORS AND ALLOWING FOR THE VANITY AND WEAKNESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASSUME THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL ATTESTED INSTANCES OF REMARKABLE PROPHECIES AND OTHER MYSTIC PRACTICE
AS A SPECIAL MARK OF RESPECT THE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN OR A WARRIOR WAS SOMETIMES LAID OUT IN STATE IN A NEW TEEPEE WITH THE USUAL HOUSEHOLD ARTICLES AND EVEN WITH A DISH OF FOOD LEFT BESIDE IT NOT THAT THEY SUPPOSED THE SPIRIT COULD USE THE IMPLEMENTS OR EAT THE FOOD BUT MERELY AS A LAST TRIBUTE
ANOTHER FAMOUS MEDICINE MAN WAS BORN ON THE RUM RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND LIVED TO BE OVER A CENTURY OLD
IF A MAN WERE SLAIN IN BATTLE IT WAS AN OLD CUSTOM TO PLACE HIS BODY AGAINST A TREE OR ROCK IN A SITTING POSITION ALWAYS FACING THE ENEMY TO INDICATE HIS UNDAUNTED DEFIANCE AND BRAVERY EVEN IN DEATH
NO DOUBT MANY PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN COLORED TO SUIT THE NEW AGE AND UNQUESTIONABLY FALSE PROPHETS FAKIRS AND CONJURERS HAVE BECOME THE PEST OF THE TRIBES DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD
THIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO THE LETTER
AT EVERY MEAL TIME A DISH OF FOOD WAS PLACED UNDER IT AND SOME PERSON OF THE SAME SEX AND AGE AS THE ONE WHO WAS GONE MUST AFTERWARD BE INVITED IN TO PARTAKE OF THE FOOD
REINCARNATION AND THE CONVERSE OF SPIRITS
THERE ARE MANY TRUSTWORTHY MEN AND MEN OF CHRISTIAN FAITH TO VOUCH FOR THESE AND SIMILAR EVENTS OCCURRING AS FORETOLD
AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD JUST LEFT FORT ELLIS ON THE ASSINIBOINE RIVER AND MY YOUNGEST UNCLE HAD SELECTED A FINE SPOT FOR OUR NIGHT CAMP
THEREFORE HE COURTS DEATH IN BATTLE ON THE OTHER HAND HE WOULD REGARD IT AS DISGRACEFUL TO BE KILLED IN A PRIVATE QUARREL
WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH
BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LARVAE
IT IS DISGRACEFUL
THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY
HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL
A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER
THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS
THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL
SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT
THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
HERE COMES THE SNAPPING TURTLE
THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
SCARED DAH WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE
OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER
AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU
AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES
BUT THE WOOD PIGEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL
CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOOD PIGEON
YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH YOUR NESTS BY YOURSELVES
FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRISS CROSS AS THE MAGPIE HAD SHOWN HER
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN
OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME
THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASK HER TO TEACH US
AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY
AND WHERE EACH BIRD PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST
SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE
SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER BIRD
SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPPING TWITTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE
O WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NIGHT AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY
SHE POPPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES
AND SHE SAW THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY
THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENT DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS
CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACKDAW
SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BIRDIKINS
MUCH LUCK MAY YOU HAVE
AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSY NEST IN THE ELM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
INDEED IT IS NOT A NEST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE
HERE WOOD PIGEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLACE THOSE STICKS THROUGH AND ACROSS CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO
IN MOMENTS OF DEEP FEELING ALIKE SUDDEN BURSTS OF PROSPERITY AS IN DARKER HOURS MAN MUST BE ALONE
IN THE PRESENT UNSETTLED THOUGH HOPEFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS FERDINAND WOULD NOT GO HOME
HE MIGHT BE ENCHANTED BUT THAT WAS THE TALISMAN
FERDINAND MEDITATES OVER HIS GOOD FORTUNE
HOW MANY INCIDENTS HOW MANY CHARACTERS HOW MANY FEELINGS FLITTED OVER HIS MEMORY OF WHAT SWEET AND BITTER EXPERIENCE DID HE NOT CHEW THE CUD
HIS CONSTANCY TO HER WAS NOW REWARDED
HE COULD NOT FLATTER HIMSELF THAT HE INDEED MERITED SUCH SINGULAR BLESSINGS AND YET WITH ALL HIS FAULTS WHICH WITH HIM WERE BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FIERY YOUTH FERDINAND HAD BEEN FAITHFUL TO HENRIETTA
RESTLESS WITH IMPENDING JOY HE SAUNTERED TO THE BRIDGE AND LEANT OVER THE BALUSTRADE GAZING ON THE WATERS IN CHARMED AND CHARMING VACANCY
IT WAS INDEED DANCING ON A VOLCANO
IT WAS INDEED HER HANDWRITING
THE MOST GIFTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE LAND EMULATED EACH OTHER IN PROVING WHICH ENTERTAINED FOR HIM THE MOST SINCERE AFFECTION
FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS AGO AND HE DEEMED HIMSELF THE MOST MISERABLE AND FORLORN OF HUMAN BEINGS AND NOW ALL THE BLESSINGS OF THE WORLD SEEMED SHOWERED AT HIS FEET
FERDINAND FELT HIS FREEDOM AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS
AS FOR HIS FRIENDS THE FUTURE MUST PROVE HIS GRATITUDE TO THEM
IS PAPA ALONE ENQUIRED MISS TEMPLE
WAS IT NOT ALL A DREAM OF HIS OWN CREATION WHILE HIS EYE HAD BEEN FIXED IN ABSTRACTION ON THAT BRIGHT AND FLOWING RIVER
THIS VIOLENT AND TRIUMPHANT REVOLUTION IN HIS PROSPECTS AND HIS FORTUNES WAS HARDLY YET COMPLETELY COMPREHENDED BY OUR FRIEND FERDINAND ARMINE AND WHEN HE HAD LEFT A NOTE FOR THE GENEROUS MIRABEL WHOSE SLUMBERS HE WOULD NOT DISTURB AT THIS EARLY HOUR EVEN WITH GOOD NEWS HE STROLLED ALONG UP CHARLES STREET AND TO THE PARK IN ONE OF THOSE WILD AND JOYOUS REVERIES IN WHICH WE BROOD OVER COMING BLISS AND CREATE A THOUSAND GLORIOUS CONSEQUENCES
IT REQUIRES SOME SELF COMMUNION TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR GOOD FORTUNE AS WELL AS TO ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY AND DANGER AND DISGRACE
AND NOW ALL HAD ENDED SO HAPPILY
IN EXACTLY TEN MINUTES IT IS IN THE POWER OF EVERY MAN TO FREE HIMSELF FROM ALL THE TUMULT OF THE WORLD THE PANGS OF LOVE THE THROBS OF AMBITION THE WEAR AND TEAR OF PLAY THE RECRIMINATING BOUDOIR THE CONSPIRING CLUB THE RATTLING HELL AND FIND HIMSELF IN A SUBLIME SYLVAN SOLITUDE SUPERIOR TO THE CEDARS OF LEBANON AND INFERIOR ONLY IN EXTENT TO THE CHESTNUT FORESTS OF ANATOLIA
AT THIS TIME GRANT WAS NOT TAKEN WITH WAR AND PROBABLY EVINCED LITTLE INTEREST IN ARMY TACTICS
THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF HON THOMAS L HAMER HE WAS ADMITTED AT WEST POINT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
TIME WORE AWAY AND ON THE NINTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE GRANT CAPTURED THE CONFEDERATE ARMY UNDER LEE THUS VIRTUALLY ENDING THE WAR
THE CAPTURE OF LEE WAS A FAR MORE DIFFICULT UNDERTAKING
HE WAS NOW COMMANDER OF ALL THE FEDERAL FORCES
HIS SUCCESS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE OUTGROWTH OF HARD STUDY AND ABILITY TO PERFORM THE MOST EXHAUSTIVE LABOR WITHOUT FATIGUE
WHEN HIS PUBLIC SERVICES WERE FINISHED HE STARTED IN COMPANY WITH HIS WIFE SON JESSE AND A FEW FRIENDS
INDEED IF EVER A GENERAL DESERVED HONOR GRANT HAD WON IT HE HAD OPENED THE MISSISSIPPI TO NAVIGATION AND HAD CAPTURED NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS AND ARMS
GENERAL HALLECK IN SPEAKING OF THIS BATTLE SAID
GRANT ACTED AS MUSTERING OFFICER UNTIL BEING COMMISSIONED COLONEL OF THE TWENTY FIRST ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS HE TOOK THE FIELD
AND THEN HE TALKED OF HER MOTHER AND HE MADE HER PRAY
HE SUFFERED ALL THE PANGS OF A MOTHER AND HE KNEW NOT WHAT IT MEANT FOR THAT GREAT AND SINGULAR MOVEMENT OF A HEART WHICH BEGINS TO LOVE IS A VERY OBSCURE AND A VERY SWEET THING
WHO KNOWS WHETHER JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT BEEN ON THE EVE OF GROWING DISCOURAGED AND OF FALLING ONCE MORE
HE HAD RETURNED TO PRISON THIS TIME FOR HAVING DONE RIGHT HE HAD QUAFFED FRESH BITTERNESS DISGUST AND LASSITUDE WERE OVERPOWERING HIM EVEN THE MEMORY OF THE BISHOP PROBABLY SUFFERED A TEMPORARY ECLIPSE THOUGH SURE TO REAPPEAR LATER ON LUMINOUS AND TRIUMPHANT BUT AFTER ALL THAT SACRED MEMORY WAS GROWING DIM
HE WAS THAT CHILD'S STAY AND SHE WAS HIS PROP
HIS SISTER AND HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN HAD LEFT HIM ONLY A VAGUE AND FAR OFF MEMORY WHICH HAD FINALLY ALMOST COMPLETELY VANISHED HE HAD MADE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND THEM AND NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM
COSETTE WAS NO LONGER IN RAGS SHE WAS IN MOURNING
TO MEET WAS TO FIND EACH OTHER
WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK THESE TWO BEINGS LED A HAPPY LIFE IN THAT HOVEL
COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD ALSO UNKNOWN TO HERSELF BECOME ANOTHER BEING POOR LITTLE THING
ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND FIFTY AND COSETTE EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED TOGETHER INTO A SORT OF INEFFABLE LIGHT
HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSIONED THE OLD WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN
NATURE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY YEARS HAD SET A PROFOUND GULF BETWEEN JEAN VALJEAN AND COSETTE DESTINY FILLED IN THIS GULF
THE MAN NO LONGER PRODUCED ON HER THE EFFECT OF BEING OLD OR POOR SHE THOUGHT JEAN VALJEAN HANDSOME JUST AS SHE THOUGHT THE HOVEL PRETTY
MOREOVER JEAN VALJEAN HAD CHOSEN HIS REFUGE WELL
WHEN THESE TWO SOULS PERCEIVED EACH OTHER THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER AND EMBRACED EACH OTHER CLOSELY
SHE FELT THAT WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE A SENSATION OF EXPANSION
THE HEART OF THAT EX CONVICT WAS FULL OF VIRGINITY
THE BEST OF US ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM EGOTISTICAL THOUGHTS
HE PROTECTED HER AND SHE STRENGTHENED HIM
ALAS HE WALKED WITH NO LESS INDECISION THAN COSETTE
HE PASSED HOURS IN WATCHING HER DRESSING AND UNDRESSING HER DOLL AND IN LISTENING TO HER PRATTLE
HE HAD NEVER BEEN FATHER LOVER HUSBAND FRIEND
I'LL PLAY FOR YOU NOW NEATH THE APPLE BOUGH AND YOU SHALL DREAM ON THE LAWN SO SHADY LADY LADY MY FAIR LADY O MY APPLE GOLD LADY
LADY LADY MY ROSE WHITE LADY BUT WILL YOU NOT HEAR A ROUNDEL LADY
THE WANDERING SINGER
BUT IF I PLAY YOU A ROUNDEL LADY GET ME A GIFT FROM THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER HER FINGER RING FOR MY FINGER BRING THOUGH SHE'S PLEDGED A THOUSAND LEAGUES OVER THE WATER LADY LADY MY FAIR LADY O MY ROSE WHITE LADY
THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER
THE WANDERING SINGER
YOU SEE THE TREATMENT IS A TRIFLE FANCIFUL
NOW YOU MAY PLAY A SERENA SINGER A DREAM OF NIGHT FOR AN APPLE GOLD LADY FOR THE FRUIT IS NOW ON THE APPLE BOUGH AND THE MOON IS UP AND THE LAWN IS SHADY SINGER SINGER WANDERING SINGER O MY HONEY SWEET SINGER
THE WANDERING SINGER APPROACHES THEM WITH HIS LUTE
BUT THIS IS A FALLACY
THE LADIES
BED TIME CHILDREN
WORSE AND WORSE HE IS EVEN PRESUMED TO BE THE CAPTIVE'S SWEETHEART WHO WHEEDLES THE FLOWER THE RING AND THE PRISON KEY OUT OF THE STRICT VIRGINS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES AND FLIES WITH HER AT LAST IN HIS SHALLOP ACROSS THE SEA TO LIVE WITH HER HAPPILY EVER AFTER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF THE LADIES
ONCE MORE THE SINGER PLAYS AND THE LADIES DANCE BUT ONE BY ONE THEY FALL ASLEEP TO THE DROWSY MUSIC AND THEN THE SINGER STEPS INTO THE RING AND UNLOCKS THE TOWER AND KISSES THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER
FORGOTTEN TOO THE NAME OF GILLIAN THE LOVELY CAPTIVE
SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK THOUGH WE DANCED A WEEK WITH HER THOUGHTS A THOUSAND LEAGUES OVER THE WATER SINGER SINGER WANDERING SINGER O MY HONEY SWEET SINGER
THE LADIES IN YELLOW DRESSES STAND AGAIN IN A RING ABOUT THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER AND ARE FOR THE LAST TIME ACCOSTED BY THE SINGER WITH HIS LUTE
BUT I DID ONCE HAVE THE LUCK TO HEAR AND SEE THE LADY PLAYED IN ENTIRETY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN GRANTED LEAVE TO PLAY JUST ONE MORE GAME BEFORE BED TIME AND OF COURSE THEY CHOSE THE LONGEST AND PLAYED IT WITHOUT MISSING A SYLLABLE
O IF YOU PLAY US A ROUNDEL SINGER HOW CAN THAT HARM THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER
I BECAME GROTESQUELY ANXIOUS TO ASSURE HIM THAT INDEED SHE AND I HAD BEEN AS THEY SAY INNOCENT THROUGHOUT OUR LAST DAY TOGETHER
BUT NOW IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER VERY MUCH
IF WE HAD BEEN BROTHER AND SISTER INDEED THERE WAS NOTHING
IT WAS THAT IDEA OF WASTE THAT DOMINATED MY MIND IN A STRANGE INTERVIEW I HAD WITH JUSTIN
IT SEEMS TO ME MORE AND MORE AS I LIVE LONGER THAT MOST POETRY AND MOST LITERATURE AND PARTICULARLY THE LITERATURE OF THE PAST IS DISCORDANT WITH THE VASTNESS AND VARIETY THE RESERVES AND RESOURCES AND RECUPERATIONS OF LIFE AS WE LIVE IT TO DAY
HOW WE MUST SIMPLIFY
SHE WAS DESTROYED NOT MERELY BY THE UNCONSIDERED UNDISCIPLINED PASSIONS OF HER HUSBAND AND HER LOVER BUT BY THE VAST TRADITION THAT SUSTAINS AND ENFORCES THE SUBJUGATION OF HER SEX
WE RANGE WIDER LAST LONGER AND ESCAPE MORE AND MORE FROM INTENSITY TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING
IT IS THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE UNDER CRUDER AND MORE RIGID CONDITIONS THAN OURS LIVED BY PEOPLE WHO LOVED AND HATED MORE NAIVELY AGED SOONER AND DIED YOUNGER THAN WE DO
WHAT ALTERNATIVE WAS THERE FOR HER
IN MARY IT SEEMS TO ME I FOUND BOTH WOMANHOOD AND FELLOWSHIP I FOUND WHAT MANY HAVE DREAMT OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP FREELY GIVEN AND I COULD DO NOTHING BUT CLUTCH AT HER TO MAKE HER MY POSSESSION
FOR A TIME THE DEATH OF MARY OBSCURED HER LIFE FOR ME BUT NOW HER LIVING PRESENCE IS MORE IN MY MIND AGAIN
WE NEVER PLANNED TO MEET AND WHEN WE MET
YOU WERE WRONG IN ALL THAT I SAID SHE KEPT HER FAITH WITH YOU
AND ALREADY THIS ASTOUNDING BLOW BEGINS TO TAKE ITS PLACE AMONG OTHER EVENTS AS A THING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE INDEED BUT RELATED TO ALL THE STRANGENESS AND MYSTERY OF LIFE PART OF THE UNIVERSAL MYSTERIES OF DESPAIR AND FUTILITY AND DEATH THAT HAVE TROUBLED MY CONSCIOUSNESS SINCE CHILDHOOD
AND IT IS UPON THIS EFFECT OF SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL POSSIBILITIES CAUGHT IN THE NET OF ANIMAL JEALOUSIES AND THOUGHTLESS MOTIVES AND ANCIENT RIGID INSTITUTIONS THAT I WOULD END THIS WRITING
THEY SAT DOWN AND LISTENED IN SILENCE
WAS THERE EVER A HAPPIER MAN THAN JOSEPH THAT NIGHT AS HE STRODE ALONG THE FOOTPATH
LET BUT A MOOD BE STRONG ENOUGH AND THE SOUL CLOTHING ITSELF IN THAT MOOD AS WITH A GARMENT CAN WALK ABROAD AND HAUNT THE WORLD
HAST THOU YET TO LEARN THAT THE LOVE OF THE HUMAN IS LOVE IS DIVINE IS BUT A LOWER FORM OF A PART OF THE LOVE OF GOD
WHEN THOU LOVEST MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD YEA OR EVEN DOG ARIGHT THEN WILT THOU NO LONGER NEED THAT I TELL THEE HOW GOD AND HIS CHRIST WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH EACH OTHER ALONE IN THE GLORIES EVEN OF THE ETERNAL ORIGINAL LOVE BECAUSE THEY COULD CREATE MORE LOVE
IT CRIED ALOUD THAT ETERNITY WAS VERY LONG AND LIKE A GREAT PALACE WITHOUT A QUIET ROOM
HE PRESSED HIS VIOLIN CASE TO HIS HEART AS IF IT WERE A LIVING THING THAT COULD KNOW THAT HE LOVED IT
HER HEART SEEMED TO SWELL UP INTO HER THROAT AND IT WAS ALL SHE COULD DO TO KEEP FROM WEEPING
THE NETTLE AND THE DOCK SAID JOSEPH
HE THAT LOVETH NOT HIS BROTHER WHOM HE HATH SEEN HOW SHALL HE LOVE GOD WHOM HE HATH NOT SEEN
IT'S JUST LIKE HIM HE MURMURED
THE MUSIC WAS BROKEN AND JOSEPH LEFT ALONE WITH THE DUMB INSTRUMENTS
EARTH WAS GONE AND HEAVEN WAS ALL
HOW IT HAPPENED HE NEVER COULD TELL BUT HE BROUGHT DOWN HIS VIOLIN WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE PIANO THEN SOMEHOW STUMBLED AND ALL BUT FELL
IN THE ACT OF RECOVERING HIMSELF HE HEARD THE NECK OF HIS INSTRUMENT PART FROM THE BODY WITH A TEARING DISCORDANT CRY LIKE THE SOUND OF THE RUIN OF A LIVING WORLD
BLESSED AM I HERE NOW MY GOD AND BLESSED SHALL I BE THERE THEN
BUT IN HIS HANDS SOLITUDE AND A VIOLIN WERE SURE TO MARRY IN MUSIC
A SOB LIKE A BIRD NEW BORN BURST FROM MARY'S BOSOM
HE WAS IN A MOOD FOR MUSIC WAS HE NOT
HIS VIOLIN WAS BROKEN BUT HIS BEING WAS MADE WHOLE
THAT ENCHANTMENT HAD POSSESSED HIM USURPING AS IT WERE THE THRONE OF HIS LIFE AND DISPLACING IT WHEN IT CEASED HE WAS NOT HIS OWN MASTER
WHEN HE REACHED THE SUBURBS THE LIGHT OF HOMES WAS SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS OF ALL COLORS
HE LAID DOWN HIS VIOLIN AND SEATED HIMSELF WHERE MARY TOLD HIM IN HER FATHER'S ARM CHAIR BY THE FIRE
LETTY FINDING HERSELF NOT QUITE EQUAL TO THE EMERGENCY CAME IN HER TURN TO CALL MARY SHE WENT AS QUIETLY AS IF SHE WERE LEAVING A TIRESOME VISITOR
JUST THEN HE WAS IN NO MOOD TO THINK OF THE SORROWS
HE STARTED TO CONSCIOUS CONFUSION ONLY NEITHER KNOWING WHERE HE WAS NOR WHAT HE DID
HIS TREASURE TAKEN TYPE OF HIS SELF AND A WOMAN GIVEN HIM INSTEAD
ONE WINTER EVENING AS SOON AS HIS WORK WAS OVER FOR THE DAY JOSEPH LOCKED THE DOOR OF HIS SMITHY WASHED HIMSELF WELL PUT ON CLEAN CLOTHES AND TAKING HIS VIOLIN SET OUT FOR TESTBRIDGE MARY WAS EXPECTING HIM TO TEA
A LITTLE LONGER AND SHE WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD AND THE SILENT TEARS FLOWED FREELY
NOR WAS THIS EXACTLY THE SHAPE THE THING TOOK TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE MUSICIAN
I LOVE THEE I LOVE THEE CRIED THE VIOLIN AND THE WORSHIP WAS ENTREATY THAT KNEW NOT ITSELF
LETTY TOO WAS OVERCOME MORE THAN EVER SHE HAD BEEN BY MUSIC
IT WAS THE AFTERNOON OF A HOLIDAY AND SHE HAD CLOSED EARLY
IT WAS A DIFFERENT HARRY WHO STARTED HOME LATE IN APRIL
IF YOU'VE GOT PISTOLS JUST YOU THINK ONCE BEFORE YOU SHOOT SAID COLLINS
BUT HE SAW NOTHING THAT MOVED THERE NO SIGNAL LIGHTS TWINKLED
HARRY FEELING PRIDE BUT NOT SHOWING IT SALUTED AND LEFT THE ROOM GOING AT ONCE TO MADAME DELAUNAY'S WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIS BAGGAGE
COLONEL LEONIDAS TALBOT REGARDED THE WHITE FLAG WITH FEELINGS IN WHICH TRIUMPH AND SADNESS WERE MINGLED STRANGELY
CHAPTER SEVEN THE HOMECOMING
WE NEED KENTUCKY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A VERY LITTLE MORE MAY BRING THE STATE TO US GO WITH YOUR FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A BRAVE YOUNG SOLDIER HERE AND MAY YOU DO AS WELL UP THERE
HE DID NOT SAY THE LAST AS A BOAST BUT MERELY AS AN ASSURANCE TO THE LIVERYMAN WHO HE SAW WAS ANXIOUS ON HIS ACCOUNT
WHETHER THEIR MANNER WAS GRAVE OR FRIVOLOUS HE KNEW THAT THESE WERE GOOD FRIENDS OF HIS AND HE SINCERELY HOPED THAT HE WOULD MEET THEM AGAIN
THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE NOTE OF GLOOM
ALL THE AMENITIES WERE PRESERVED BETWEEN THE CAPTURED GARRISON AND THEIR CAPTORS
HE WAS GOING HOME AFTER VICTORY
THE AIR TOO WAS UNLIKE THAT OF SOUTH CAROLINA THERE WAS A SHARPER TANG TO IT
PEOPLE WERE COOLER HERE AND THEY WERE MORE PRONE TO LOOK AT THE TWO SIDES OF A QUESTION
IT WAS ALMOST BURIED NOW IN FLOWERS AND FOLIAGE
BUT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE SOON COMPLETED
THE PROGRESS OF PRESIDENT DAVIS TO THE NEW CAPITAL SET IN THE VERY FACE OF THE FOE WAS TO BE ONE HUGE TRIUMPH OF FAITH AND LOYALTY
THAT WHITE FLAG AND THOSE BOATS GOING OUT MEAN THAT SUMTER IS OURS
AN EXTRAORDINARY WAVE OF EMOTION SWEPT OVER THE SOUTH CARRYING EVERYBODY WITH IT
HE FELT THE DIFFERENCE AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE HILLS OF HIS NATIVE STATE
LINCOLN HAD CALLED FOR VOLUNTEERS TO PUT DOWN A REBELLION BUT HARRY HEARD EVERYWHERE IN CHARLESTON THAT THE CONFEDERACY WAS NOW SECURE
IT WAS AFTERNOON WHEN HE REACHED THE LITTLE STATION OF WINTON AND LEFT THE TRAIN A TALL STURDY BOY THE SUPERIOR OF MANY A MAN IN SIZE STRENGTH AND AGILITY
BUT HE LOOKED BACK AT CHARLESTON THE GAY THE VOLATILE AND THE BEAUTIFUL WITH REAL AFFECTION
HE GAZED UPON A WORLD FULL OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERILS
IT WHIPPED HIS BLOOD AS IT BLEW DOWN FROM THE SLOPES AND CRESTS
THE GREAT STATE OF VIRGINIA MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS WENT OUT OF THE UNION AT LAST AND NORTH CAROLINA TENNESSEE AND ARKANSAS FOLLOWED HER BUT MARYLAND KENTUCKY AND MISSOURI STILL HUNG IN THE BALANCE
HE SOON LEFT CHARLESTON OUT OF SIGHT
EUROPE WHICH MUST HAVE ITS COTTON WOULD FAVOR THE SUCCESS OF THE SOUTH
THE SMOKE ITSELF WHICH HAD FORMED A VAST CLOUD OVER HARBOR FORTS AND CITY WAS NOW DRIFTING OUT TO SEA LEAVING ALL THINGS ETCHED SHARPLY IN THE DAZZLING SUNLIGHT OF A SOUTHERN SPRING DAY
HARRY GAVE HIS FAREWELLS WITH DEEP AND GENUINE REGRET
BILL SKELLY AN HIS GANG THEM MOUNTAINEERS ARE UP
HE HAD SEEN GREAT THINGS AND HE HAD DONE HIS SHARE OF THEM
BOATS PUT OUT BOTH FROM THE FORT AND THE SHORE
COLONEL KENTON WRITES WISELY
THIS WAS NOT THE FASHION OF A YEAR AGO WHEN THEY EXCHANGED A FRIENDLY WORD OR TWO BUT HARRY KNEW ITS CAUSE NOW NOBODY COULD TRUST ANYBODY ELSE
HARRY THANKED HIM THREW HIS SADDLE BAGS ACROSS THE HORSE A POWERFUL BAY AND GIVING A FINAL WAVE OF HIS HAND TO THE SYMPATHETIC LIVERYMAN RODE AWAY
BEAUREGARD AT ONCE WROTE AN ORDER
BUT THE EMOTIONS OF HARRY AND HIS COMRADES WERE FOR THE MOMENT THOSE OF VICTORY ONLY
FOUR MONTHS HAD MADE GREAT CHANGES HE BORE HIMSELF MORE LIKE A MAN HIS MANNER WAS MUCH MORE CONSIDERED AND GRAVE
THERE WERE NEVER BEFORE SUCH TIMES IN OLD KENTUCKY
HE INTENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT FIRST HE SOUGHT HIS FRIENDS AND TOLD THEM GOOD BYE
WHILE THEY WERE TALKING THE BEGGAR HAD TAKEN THE APPLES WHICH THE GIRLS WERE TO EAT FOR DESSERT AND HAD SPRINKLED A SLEEPING POWDER OVER THEM
HAVE PITY UPON A POOR UNFORTUNATE ONE HE CALLED OUT
IF WE DECIDE TO SHOW MERCY TO THIS POOR BEGGAR IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO OPPOSE IT
THEY TRIED IN VAIN TO BREAK DOWN THE GREAT DOORS
ALL MY WORRIES ABOUT YOU WERE FOOLISH
BUI WE SHOULD NOT FORGET OUR PROMISE TO OUR FATHER CRIED THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
LET ME ENTER I PRAY YOU TO PASS THE NIGHT UNDER YOUR ROOF
THE TWO ELDEST ATE THEIR APPLES BUT THE YOUNGEST COULD NOT EAT THAT NIGHT SHE THREW THE APPLE AWAY
THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AT FIRST DID NOT ANSWER BUT AS HE KEPT ON CALLING TO HER SHE FINALLY ASKED HIM WHAT IT WAS THAT HE WANTED
WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS STICKING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE DOOR
SHE DID NOT STIR AND HE KNEW THAT THE SLEEPING POWDER HAD THOROUGHLY DONE ITS WORK
HOW DO YOU KNOW ASKED THEIR FATHER I AM OLDER AND WISER THAN YOU ARE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY EVILS WHICH MIGHT COME UPON YOU
WHEN IT WAS EVENING HE LED HIS BAND INTO A NEARBY STREET AND IN HIS DISGUISE APPROACHED THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
THEN SHE HEARD HIM GO DOWN THE STAIRWAY AND UNBOLT THE HEAVY DOORS WHICH LED INTO THE STORE
THE CRIES AND CURSES OF THE ROBBERS FILLED THE AIR
I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO YOU NO HARM
YOU SHALL NOT COME INTO MY FATHER'S HOUSE
LONG AGO THERE LIVED A MERCHANT WHO HAD THREE DAUGHTERS
IT WAS THE YOUNGEST ONE WHO DECEIVED ME CRIED THE ROBBER CHIEFTAIN
PERHAPS YOU CAN OUTWIT HER YET CRIED ANOTHER
EVERY YEAR AT A CERTAIN DAY OF A CERTAIN MONTH HE WENT AWAY TO A DISTANT CITY TO COLLECT MONEY ON AN ACCOUNT
PASS THE CHARM OUT TO ME THEN SAID THE ROBBER
IT'S SURELY A TERRIBLE STORM OUTSIDE SAID THE MERCHANT'S ELDEST DAUGHTER AS THE WIND RATTLED THE TILES OF THE ROOF AND THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE DOORS AND WINDOWS
HOWEVER IN SPITE OF ALL SHE COULD SAY THE ELDER SISTERS OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE BEGGAR
IT IS A FEARFUL NIGHT TO SEND AWAY A BEGGAR SAID THE ELDEST SISTER WHILE THEY WERE EATING
HE IS OLD AS WELL AS POOR SHE SAID
COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE
BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN
BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH
HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETHEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY
CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETHEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL
HOW CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES
THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK
AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES
HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US
DEAR GOOD GOD HELP US NOW SHE PRAYED
BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN
GRETHEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM
AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN
SEE I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF
GRETHEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED
OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLANE THE COFFINS FOR US
WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN
AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE
THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE
THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAY LAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREADHOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY
AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT
EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE
THAT NIGHT THE ENEMY SLIPPED AWAY LEAVING HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HIS DEAD AND WOUNDED ON THE FIELD
I REMAINED AWAKE ALL NIGHT TALKING WITH A COMRADE WHO SHARED MY BLANKET WITH ME POOR JIMMY KING
IT REQUIRED MONTHS AND GREAT EVENTS TO MAKE GRANT THE HERO OF THE ARMY WHICH HE AFTERWARD BECAME
ROSECRANS PROTESTED IT WAS IN VAIN
FIFTEEN OFFICERS OF OUR LITTLE HALF REGIMENT WERE DEAD OR WOUNDED
ONE DARING REBEL WAS SHOT DOWN AND BAYONETED CLEAR BEHIND THE LINE OF COMPANY B WHERE HE HAD BROKEN THROUGH TO SEIZE THE FLAG OF MY REGIMENT
THE CLOUD OF REBELS WE HAD SEEN DIVIDED ITSELF INTO THREE COLUMNS
MY OWN REGIMENT WAS IN THE ADVANCE
I COULD NOT HELP MY FRIEND
ONCE IN THE NIGHT I SLIPPED AWAY FROM THE BIVOUAC AND HURRIED TO THE OLD TISHIMINGO HOTEL TO SEE A LIEUTENANT OF MY COMPANY WHO HAD BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE BREAST
GRANT WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY BUT ALTHOUGH COMMANDER IN CHIEF HE KNEW NOTHING OF THE HARDEST FOUGHT BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR UNTIL IT WAS OVER
I HASTENED BACK TO THE LINES
THEY LAY IN HEAPS OF DOZENS EVEN CLOSE UP TO THE WORKS
MY FRIEND WITH MANY OTHERS WAS BEING CARRIED OUT TO DIE ELSEWHERE
UNDER THE SAME QUIET MOONLIGHT AND ONLY SIX HUNDRED YARDS AWAY FROM US ALSO LAY THE VICTORIOUS REBEL ARMY
THERE WERE NO BREASTWORKS YET THAT ONE LITTLE BRIGADE OF HAMILTON'S DIVISION STOOD THERE IN THE OPEN AND REPULSED ASSAULT AFTER ASSAULT
OUR BRIGADE WAS FEARFULLY OUTNUMBERED
THAT EVENING AN ORDER CAME FOR US HAMILTON'S DIVISION TO ASSAULT THE ENEMY'S LEFT FLANK AT MIDNIGHT
GO BACK TO THE REGIMENT HE SAID SMILING ALL WILL BE NEEDED
A PERFECT BLAZE OF CLOSE RANGE MUSKETRY TOO MOWED THEM DOWN LIKE GRASS
A WEEK AFTER THE BATTLE MY BROTHER RODE BY THERE ON A CAVALRY EXPEDITION AND MADE THE HORRIBLE DISCOVERY THAT HOGS WERE EATING UP THE BODIES OF OUR DEAD HEROES THAT TOO WAS WAR
WHEN MORNING CAME THE FIRING OPENED AND FOR ALL THAT DAY THE BATTLE RAGED FIERCELY AT THE LEFT AND CENTER LEFT WE GETTING THE WORST OF IT TOO
NO BATTERY IN THE WHOLE FOUR YEARS WAR LOST SO MANY MEN IN SO SHORT A TIME
INDEED WE OF THE RANK AND FILE HAD LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN GRANT IN THOSE DAYS
IT WAS NOT A QUESTION WHO WAS DEAD OR WOUNDED BUT WHO WAS NOT
WITH A FEW LANTERNS OUR MEN THEN WENT ABOUT AND TRIED TO GATHER UP THE WOUNDED THE DEAD WERE LEFT TILL MORNING
THAT NIGHT I STOOD GUARD UNDER AN OAK TREE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AMONG THE UNBURIED DEAD
NOT BALAKLAVA NOR THE ALMA SAW SUCH FIGHTING IT WAS A DUEL TO THE DEATH
HE SURVIVED THE WAR ONLY TO BE MURDERED LATER ON A PLANTATION IN MISSISSIPPI
FOR SOME REASON THE DEAD AT HATCHIE BRIDGE WERE NOT BURIED
BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNCAN GOD FORBID
THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE THEM
THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED
WILL HALLEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN
MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION ON THE PAMPAS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS
WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JOHN
YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN
HIS EYES WANDERED CEASELESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORIZON
SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
WHAT THEN MY LORD
WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT
THINK OF LADY GLENARVAN THINK OF MARY GRANT
GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHN
FORTUNATELY WILL HALLEY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESS OF CANVAS OR HIS MASTS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN
JOHN MANGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HULL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FROM THE DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG
WATCH THE SAVAGES OUTSIDE SAID ROBERT
THEY HAD ONE NIGHT IN WHICH TO PREPARE FOR DEATH
DID THEY KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRISONERS OR WAS IT SOME PRIVATE ENTERPRISE THAT LED TO THE UNDERTAKING
WHAT COULD BE THE OBJECT
THEY WERE NOT TO LEAVE IT AGAIN TILL THE TOPS OF THE WAHITI RANGES WERE LIT WITH THE FIRST FIRES OF DAY
BUT SOFTLY AS THE NAME WAS BREATHED MARY GRANT ALREADY AWAKENED BY THE SOUNDS IN THE HUT SLIPPED OVER TOWARD GLENARVAN AND SEIZING THE HAND ALL STAINED WITH EARTH SHE COVERED IT WITH KISSES
JOHN YOU HAVE PROMISED MARY WHAT I PROMISED LADY HELENA WHAT IS YOUR PLAN
THE JAILER MAY FORGET THAT HE IS ON GUARD THE PRISONER NEVER FORGETS THAT HE IS GUARDED
AT LAST THE MAJOR SAID MY FRIENDS KEEP THAT TO THE LAST MOMENT
GLENARVAN'S VOICE FIRM TILL NOW FALTERED
LISTEN SAID HE MOTIONING THEM TO STOOP
GOD WHO READS OUR HEARTS KNOWS THAT WE HAD A NOBLE END IN VIEW
MY LORD WHICHEVER OF US SURVIVES THE OTHER WILL FULFILL THE WISH OF LADY HELENA AND MARY GRANT
I BELIEVE SAID JOHN THAT IN THE SIGHT OF GOD I HAVE A RIGHT TO FULFILL THAT PROMISE
IF IT IS DECREED THAT WE DIE TO MORROW LET US DIE BRAVELY LIKE CHRISTIAN MEN READY TO APPEAR WITHOUT TERROR BEFORE THE SUPREME JUDGE
ON THAT SIDE DESCENT WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE THE BOTTOM WAS SHUT IN BY THE ENORMOUS ROCK
JOHN MANGLES INSERTING THE BLADE OF HIS PONIARD AVOIDED THE KNIFE WHICH NOW PROTRUDED ABOVE THE SOIL BUT SEIZED THE HAND THAT WIELDED IT
MY CHILD MY CHILD MURMURED LADY HELENA THE SAVAGES DID NOT KILL YOU
WILSON AND OLBINETT JOINED THEIR COMPANIONS AND ALL UNITED TO DIG THROUGH THE WALL JOHN WITH HIS DAGGER THE OTHERS WITH STONES TAKEN FROM THE GROUND OR WITH THEIR NAILS WHILE MULRADY STRETCHED ALONG THE GROUND WATCHED THE NATIVE GUARD THROUGH A CREVICE OF THE MATTING
SLEEP WHICH KEEPS ALL SORROW IN ABEYANCE SOON WEIGHED DOWN THEIR EYELIDS THEY SLEPT IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS OVERCOME BY EXHAUSTION AND PROLONGED WATCHING
THE MEAL ENDED
ANIMAL OR MAN ANSWERED THE MAJOR I WILL SOON FIND OUT
ROUND HIS BODY WAS ROLLED A LONG COIL OF FLAX ROPE
THEIR FINGERS BLED BUT STILL THEY WORKED ON AFTER HALF AN HOUR THEY HAD GONE THREE FEET DEEP THEY PERCEIVED BY THE INCREASED SHARPNESS OF THE SOUNDS THAT ONLY A THIN LAYER OF EARTH PREVENTED IMMEDIATE COMMUNICATION
AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARN AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STOREHOUSE
IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT
BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MADE THE GAS FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANY THING FOR HARM ONLY
WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING
WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOT PATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE LITTLE CARS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES
THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND
FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES
HERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ROUNDED LIKE A NUT SHELL YOU CAN SPLIT OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE NUT LYING SNUGLY AS DOES ANY CHESTNUT IN ITS BUR
THESE FORESTS WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WE HAVE NOW GREAT FERNS AS TALL AS THIS HOUSE AND MOSSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PALM LEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE
THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPES DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOKS DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US
WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD KEPT ON BURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY
SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LYING ASLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STREWED AMONG THEM
LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE
FOR WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL
WHEN YOUR HANDS OR LIPS ARE CRACKED AND ROUGH FROM THE COLD DOES YOUR MOTHER EVER PUT ON GLYCERIN TO HEAL THEM
THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OF FOUNTAINS WITH THEIR SONGS
ONCE THERE WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERY THING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
DON'T YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS REFUSE COAL TAR
THEY ARE NOURISHING THEIR GREED ON THE QUIVERING FLESH AND THE WARM BLOOD OF THE PEOPLE NOTHING ELSE
VERY CHARACTERISTIC PERFECTLY TYPICAL
THEN WHY INDULGE IN PROPHETIC PHANTASIES
THE LIGHT THROWN DOWN BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOW SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIR DONE UP IN SEVERAL PLAITS FOR THE NIGHT
FOR HIM THE CRIMINAL IS THE PRISONER SIMPLE IS IT NOT
I WISH HE HAD NEVER BEEN TO SCHOOL MISSUS VERLOC BEGAN AGAIN BRUSQUELY
THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER VERLOC BECAUSE HE HAD SAT ASTRIDE VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCIPIENT FALL
THE DISDAINFUL POUT OF COMRADE OSSIPON'S THICK LIPS ACCENTUATED THE NEGRO TYPE OF HIS FACE
THE COALS IN THE GRATE SETTLED DOWN WITH A SLIGHT CRASH AND MICHAELIS THE HERMIT OF VISIONS IN THE DESERT OF A PENITENTIARY GOT UP IMPETUOUSLY
THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS THE WINDOW PANE AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD
HE GETS A RED FACE PORING OVER THEM
LOMBROSO IS AN ASS
HER BARE FEET AS IF POKED THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF AN UNADORNED SLEEVED CALICO SACK BUTTONED TIGHTLY AT NECK AND WRISTS FELT OVER THE RUG FOR THE SLIPPERS WHILE SHE LOOKED UPWARD INTO HER HUSBAND'S FACE
ALL IDEALISATION MAKES LIFE POORER
ALEXANDER OSSIPON GOT UP TALL IN HIS THREADBARE BLUE SERGE SUIT UNDER THE LOW CEILING SHOOK OFF THE STIFFNESS OF LONG IMMOBILITY AND STROLLED AWAY INTO THE KITCHEN DOWN TWO STEPS TO LOOK OVER STEVIE'S SHOULDER
STEVIE SWALLOWED THE TERRIFYING STATEMENT WITH AN AUDIBLE GULP AND AT ONCE AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWIFT POISON SANK LIMPLY IN A SITTING POSTURE ON THE STEPS OF THE KITCHEN DOOR
HIS OWN SKIN HAD SIZZLED UNDER THE RED HOT BRAND HE MURMURED SOFTLY
HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND DRINKING BLOOD WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT
THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DOCILE THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT UPSET HIS POOR HEAD
THE SHEET OF PAPER COVERED WITH CIRCLES DROPPED OUT OF HIS FINGERS AND HE REMAINED STARING AT THE OLD TERRORIST AS IF ROOTED SUDDENLY TO THE SPOT BY HIS MORBID HORROR AND DREAD OF PHYSICAL PAIN
IN ANY CASE HE HAD NOT THE TIME
THE POSSESSORS OF PROPERTY HAD NOT ONLY TO FACE THE AWAKENED PROLETARIAT BUT THEY HAD ALSO TO FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES YES
WHEN HE ROSE PAINFULLY THE THRUSTING FORWARD OF A SKINNY GROPING HAND DEFORMED BY GOUTY SWELLINGS SUGGESTED THE EFFORT OF A MORIBUND MURDERER SUMMONING ALL HIS REMAINING STRENGTH FOR A LAST STAB
HE TOOK THE CASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEVIE WAS STILL DOWNSTAIRS
HE LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW BUT HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION
YES I HAD THE TIME TO THINK THINGS OUT A LITTLE HE ADDED WITHOUT EMPHASIS
AND I COULD NEVER GET AS MANY AS THREE SUCH MEN TOGETHER
LOAFING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS WHO KNEW NOT MISTER VLADIMIR AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHEREAS HE HAD A WOMAN TO PROVIDE FOR
STEVIE ACCUSTOMED TO MOVE ABOUT DISREGARDED HAD GOT UP FROM THE KITCHEN TABLE CARRYING OFF HIS DRAWING TO BED WITH HIM
MISTER VERLOC'S ANXIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING
MISTER VERLOC WAS FULLY RESPONSIVE NOW
HE HAD BEEN A PRISONER HIMSELF
THE OLD TERRORIST TURNED SLOWLY HIS HEAD ON HIS SKINNY NECK FROM SIDE TO SIDE
THESE WERE BUT FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED HIS SHOP HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF ITS VALUE
COMRADE OSSIPON'S FACE TWITCHED WITH EXASPERATION
THAT POOR BOY IS IN A VERY EXCITED STATE TO NIGHT SHE MURMURED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH LASTED FOR THREE TICKS OF THE CLOCK
ASK KARL YUNDT HE GROWLED SAVAGELY
MICHAELIS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE SMILED VAGUELY WITH HIS GLUED LIPS HIS PASTY MOON FACE DROOPED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF MELANCHOLY ASSENT
MISTER VERLOC PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO STEVIE
WITH HIS ELBOW PRESENTING NO APPEARANCE OF A JOINT BUT MORE LIKE A BEND IN A DUMMY'S LIMB THROWN OVER THE BACK OF A CHAIR HE LEANED FORWARD SLIGHTLY OVER HIS SHORT AND ENORMOUS THIGHS TO SPIT INTO THE GRATE
AH HE DID NOT DEPEND UPON EMOTIONAL EXCITEMENT TO KEEP UP HIS BELIEF NO DECLAMATIONS NO ANGER NO VISIONS OF BLOOD RED FLAGS WAVING OR METAPHORICAL LURID SUNS OF VENGEANCE RISING ABOVE THE HORIZON OF A DOOMED SOCIETY NOT HE
WITH THE INSIGHT OF A KINDRED TEMPERAMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT
THAT BOY HEARS TOO MUCH OF WHAT IS TALKED ABOUT HERE
HE GAVE THE DISCUSSION UP WITH A SLIGHT SHRUG OF THE SHOULDERS
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HE BEGAN DISDAINFULLY BUT STOPPED SHORT INTIMIDATED BY THE DEAD BLACKNESS OF THE CAVERNOUS EYES IN THE FACE TURNED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM WITH A BLIND STARE AS IF GUIDED ONLY BY THE SOUND
IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID
THERE ARE NATURES TOO TO WHOSE SENSE OF JUSTICE THE PRICE EXACTED LOOMS UP MONSTROUSLY ENORMOUS ODIOUS OPPRESSIVE WORRYING HUMILIATING EXTORTIONATE INTOLERABLE THOSE ARE THE FANATICS
STRUGGLE WARFARE WAS THE CONDITION OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP IT WAS FATAL
AND EVER SINCE HE HAD NEVER MANAGED TO GET HIS WEIGHT DOWN AS MUCH AS AN OUNCE
HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOUR AND LOOKED INTO THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE
THE SHADOW OF HIS EVIL GIFT CLUNG TO HIM YET LIKE THE SMELL OF A DEADLY DRUG IN AN OLD VIAL OF POISON EMPTIED NOW USELESS READY TO BE THROWN AWAY UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP OF THINGS THAT HAD SERVED THEIR TIME
HE ISN'T FIT TO HEAR WHAT'S SAID HERE HE BELIEVES IT'S ALL TRUE
THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT STEVIE HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED
HIS SCARED EYES BLAZED WITH INDIGNATION IT WOULD HURT TERRIBLY HIS MOUTH DROPPED OPEN
THIS SURVEY WAS UNFAVOURABLE
HIS ENUNCIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY UNINTELLIGIBLE TO A STRANGER
HE WATCHED HIM GESTICULATING AND MURMURING IN THE KITCHEN
MICHAELIS THE TICKET OF LEAVE APOSTLE WAS SPEAKING IN AN EVEN VOICE A VOICE THAT WHEEZED AS IF DEADENED AND OPPRESSED BY THE LAYER OF FAT ON HIS CHEST
A HARSH LAUGH FROM COMRADE OSSIPON CUT THE TIRADE DEAD SHORT IN A SUDDEN FALTERING OF THE TONGUE AND A BEWILDERED UNSTEADINESS OF THE APOSTLE'S MILDLY EXALTED EYES
HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEIR BACKS WITH RESTRAINED VIOLENCE TURNED THE KEY SHOT THE BOLT
I WOULD CALL IT CANNIBALISTIC THAT'S WHAT IT IS
COMFORTABLE DEAR
I WOULDN'T GIVE A HALFPENNY FOR THE WHOLE LOT
THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT FAILS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE
IT WAS KARL YUNDT WHO WAS HEARD IMPLACABLE TO HIS LAST BREATH
HIS VISION OF TRUTH HAD GROWN SO INTENSE THAT THE SOUND OF A STRANGE VOICE FAILED TO ROUT IT THIS TIME
YES NOT AT ALL WELL
HE KNOWS NO BETTER HE GETS INTO HIS PASSIONS OVER IT
THE FAMOUS TERRORIST HAD NEVER IN HIS LIFE RAISED PERSONALLY AS MUCH AS HIS LITTLE FINGER AGAINST THE SOCIAL EDIFICE
THERE WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY FORCE OF SUGGESTION IN THIS POSTURING
HE GLARED AT ME AS IF HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS
DOWN BELOW IN THE QUIET NARROW STREET MEASURED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEN DIED AWAY UNHURRIED AND FIRM AS IF THE PASSER BY HAD STARTED TO PACE OUT ALL ETERNITY FROM GAS LAMP TO GAS LAMP IN A NIGHT WITHOUT END AND THE DROWSY TICKING OF THE OLD CLOCK ON THE LANDING BECAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE BEDROOM
I DON'T SAY THAT PROTESTED MICHAELIS GENTLY
YOU WOULD CALL THAT LAD A DEGENERATE WOULD YOU MUMBLED MISTER VERLOC
IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE SUDDENLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UNINHABITED AND THIRSTY PLAIN
THE OTHER DAY STEVIE GOT HOLD OF ONE AND THERE WAS A STORY IN IT OF A GERMAN SOLDIER OFFICER TEARING HALF OFF THE EAR OF A RECRUIT AND NOTHING WAS DONE TO HIM FOR IT THE BRUTE
HE CAN'T STAND THE NOTION OF ANY CRUELTY
HE PAUSED THEN ADDED WITH MODEST FIRMNESS
HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH HIS FRIENDS
DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF I HAD NOT BEEN THE OPTIMIST I AM I COULD NOT HAVE FOUND IN FIFTEEN YEARS SOME MEANS TO CUT MY THROAT
AT BEST THEY CAN ONLY INTERPRET THE MIND OF THE PROPHET AND CAN HAVE NO OBJECTIVE VALUE
STEVIE PROWLED ROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL IN A CAGE
A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM'S REGIMENT
A MAN IN THE WELL
WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAYBE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP
THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT
WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR
HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HELLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS
THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD
HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT
WE PASSED AROUND ATLANTA CROSSED THE CHATTAHOOCHEE AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSTON
I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE
THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
WE WERE INURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE IN EVERY SKIRMISH IN EVERY ADVANCE IN EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY IN EVERY DEFEAT
HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO
THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURFREESBORO PIKE
WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE OF TENNESSEE RIVER
OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY
WE HAD BEEF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT
ADVANCE INTO TENNESSEE
BUT AFTER AWHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN AY GANNY THE LAW
YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW
YANK SAYS WHAT YOU DOING JOHNNY
HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES
RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT
A YANKEE ALWAYS SAYS NAGER
THEY PERSUADED ELOQUENTLY
BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM
ON MONDAY MORNING I TOO CAPTURED ME A MULE
THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BATTLE IN WHICH OUR REGIMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENGAGED
SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INCH ROPE TIED ONE END AROUND THE MULE'S NECK AND THE OTHER TO THE CAISSON AND ORDERED THE DRIVER TO WHIP UP
MULE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM WITH A BIG STICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND A TWISTER ON HIS NOSE
SHILOH
ABOUT THE TIME HE PULLED TRIGGER A STRAY BALL FROM SOME DIRECTION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BECOMING FRIGHTENED GALLOPED OFF DRAGGING HIM THROUGH THE CONFEDERATE LINES
I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STOLEN A SHEEP BUT WHEN THE ORDER TO CHARGE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY
THAT'S RIGHT MY BRAVE FIRST TENNESSEE GIVE EM HAIL COLUMBIA
WE WERE SUPPORTING AN ALABAMA BRIGADE
I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BATTLEFIELDS SEEN PICTURES OF BATTLEFIELDS OF HORSES AND MEN OF CANNON AND WAGONS ALL JUMBLED TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STREWN WITH DEAD AND DYING AND WOUNDED BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT I NEVER REALIZED THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THING CALLED GLORIOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TROOPS HAD BEEN FIGHTING ALL DAY
ON SUNDAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARMY TO ADVANCE AND TO ATTACK IMMEDIATELY
ON MONDAY THE TIDE WAS REVERSED
OFFICERS COULD NOT CURB THE MEN TO KEEP IN LINE
AS GLADDEN RODE BY US A COURIER RODE UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING
THE FACT WAS KEPT FROM THE TROOPS
ABOUT DAYLIGHT ON SUNDAY MORNING CHALMERS BRIGADE RELIEVED GLADDEN'S
SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BATTLE I REFER YOU TO HISTORY
I FREQUENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEASANT TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT MULE AND I WOULD GLADLY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE HALF OF HIS NO
ON MY TAKING THE ROPE OFF HE SHOOK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHTY SMART FOLKS BUT YOU ARE A LEETLE TOO SMART
THE ROPE HOWEVER WAS STRONGER THAN THE MULE'S NO AND HE WAS FINALLY PREVAILED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE ROPE TO CROSS THE CREEK
HE WAS WISE IN HIS OWN CONCEIT
BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READER A PRIVATE SOLDIER IS BUT AN AUTOMATON AND KNOWS NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERALS AND I AM ONLY GIVING THE CHRONICLES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
I DO NOT PRETEND TO TELL OF WHAT COMMAND DISTINGUISHED ITSELF OF HEROES OF BLOOD AND WOUNDS OF SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF BRILLIANT CHARGES OF CANNON CAPTURED ET CETERA
I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
BEFORE WE ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF YANKEES APPROACHING AND AS WE STARTED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRED UPON US
I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD
AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED THAT FOOT QUICK
HE DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM
SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SECESH ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY
OAKLEY COLOR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE YANKEE LINE WITH HIS COLORS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
THE FEDERAL ARMY WAS CONCENTRATING AT NASHVILLE THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WEARY
THE YANKEES MARCHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
I CALLED LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THERE MIGHTY QUICK
WE REMAINED SEVERAL MONTHS BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRAMP AGAIN
WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE YANKEE LINE ON THE WILKERSON TURNPIKE
WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEATHAM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
THE PRIVATE COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REGIMENTS WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO PICKET DUTY
OUR ARMY STOPPED AT MURFREESBORO
BAD GENERALSHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
THE LEADEN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORMED
WE WERE ORDERED FORWARD TO THE ATTACK
LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONE'S RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE
I AM A VIDET YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY RESTING ON ME
BUT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES
I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GUN
I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER
OUR PICKETS HAD RUN IN AND REPORTED A NIGHT ATTACK
I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN
THE YANKEE PICKET LINES WERE NOT A HALF MILE OFF
WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
MYSELF I ALWAYS KNEW SHE HAD IT IN HER
MAC CONNELL LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER
OF COURSE HILDA IS IRISH THE BURGOYNES HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAMED FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAINHALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT
ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HILDA
IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN A LONDON THEATRE
THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MAINHALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET FADED EYES AND MADE A WRY FACE
DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAINHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
IN A MOMENT PEGGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLAUDED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST
I HAPPEN TO HAVE MAC CONNELL'S BOX FOR TONIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DODGING ACQUAINTANCES AS HE WENT
I DARE SAY IT'S QUITE TRUE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ONE ELSE
ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED MILDLY
IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH AMUSEMENT SIR HARRY'S JUDICIAL FROWN
THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEEDY POOR CHILD
A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF ERNEST DOWSON ET CETERA
HUGH'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPRESSIBLE
SIR HARRY TOWNE BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKYO
HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAINHALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WESTMERE OF COURSE THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOWLE
WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GOSSOONS WHAT SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR
WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE SCENE BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINCE
IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND KINDLY
AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDER'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE
AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF PHILLY'S BURROW WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PRIMROSES FOR HER DONKEY
OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OWE ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY
I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME
ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY
BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN
HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY
OH BARTLEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME
LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THEY'RE OOZING WATER
AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT
HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIR
I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW
HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME
I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING
I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING
IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONED ME OR ANYTHING
ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER
I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON
OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR
ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY
YES I KNOW VERY WELL
ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET
THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED
A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE
HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES
PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT SLEEVE
WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD
YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED
AFTER THE VERY FIRST
HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
BARTLEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH
SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY
IT IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT
SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT
THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING
IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILDA
HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE
SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS
ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW
HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS
YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT
DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED
IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE
THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED
I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT
OH BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO
AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPLASH
SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER
YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER
I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER
THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE
EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE
I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER
AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE
I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING
COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY
SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER
SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL
I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG
SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR
SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOO
I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY
HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY
IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT SOUTHWARK
EVEN THIS COMEDIAN OF JAWS AND CLAWS WAS ECLIPSED IN SUCCESS
THESE WERE REMARKABLE TALENTS
BESIDES THIS HE HARANGUED LIKE CICERO AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN SOLD HIS DRUGS ATTENDED SICKNESS AND EVEN HEALED THE SICK
THAT SUCCESS WAS PRODIGIOUS STILL IT REMAINED LOCAL
THE DOME OF SAINT PAUL'S WAS A DELIGHT TO URSUS
ONE EVENING URSUS WAS IN THE SIDE SCENE WHICH WAS THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE GREEN BOX SEEING MASTER NICLESS STANDING BY HIM SHOWED HIM THIS MAN IN THE CROWD AND ASKED HIM
HE DID NOT COME EVERY EVENING BUT WHEN HE CAME HE LED THE PUBLIC APPLAUSE GREW INTO ACCLAMATION SUCCESS ROSE NOT TO THE ROOF FOR THERE WAS NONE BUT TO THE CLOUDS FOR THERE WERE PLENTY OF THEM
AGAINST THIS WALL WAS PLACED THE GREEN BOX WHICH THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE YARD OWING TO THE HEIGHT OF THE GATE
THEY BEGAN THEIR PERFORMANCES
WITH THAT EXCEPTION THEIR SUCCESS BECAME SO GREAT THAT NO MOUNTEBANK MEMORY COULD RECALL ITS PARALLEL
THE PLACARD GWYNPLAINE THE LAUGHING MAN TAKEN FROM ITS NAIL IN THE GREEN BOX WAS HUNG UP CLOSE TO THE SIGN OF THE INN
WHICH CLOUDS SEEING THAT THERE WAS NO ROOF SOMETIMES WEPT OVER THE MASTERPIECE OF URSUS
WHAT A PITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD
BY THE SIDE OF THE DOOR WAS CONSTRUCTED OFF HAND BY MEANS OF AN EMPTY BARREL A BOX FOR THE MONEY TAKER WHO WAS SOMETIMES FIBI AND SOMETIMES VINOS
THE EMPTYING OF TANKARDS DID NOT DECREASE THEIR SUCCESS
HE WOULD MAKE A FAMOUS SCOUNDREL
ALL SOUTHWARK RAN IN CROWDS TO ADMIRE THE LAUGHING MAN
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ORDERED FOR THE GREEN BOX
HIS ENTHUSIASM CAUSED URSUS TO REMARK THIS MAN AND GWYNPLAINE TO OBSERVE HIM
THEY HAD A GREAT FRIEND IN THIS UNKNOWN VISITOR
IT WAS A THEATRE READY MADE
THE MERRY ANDREWS AND MOUNTEBANKS OF TARRINZEAU FIELD WERE AGHAST AT GWYNPLAINE
AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME REELING DRUNKARD MAKING STAGGERING SHADOWS IN DARK CORNERS
THIS CONNOISSEUR WAS SUDDENLY FASCINATED AND HAD ADOPTED THE LAUGHING MAN
WE ARE IN LONDON SAID URSUS WE MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE GENTRY
GWYNPLAINE ATE UP THEIR PUBLIC
SAINT PAUL IS A SAINT ONLY WITH EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
IT TOOK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS FOR THE NAME OF SHAKESPEARE TO PENETRATE FROM ENGLAND INTO FRANCE
URSUS WAS SATISFIED WITH THE APPLAUSE OF SOUTHWARK BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHED
AT EVERY PERFORMANCE THE YARD OF THE INN TRANSFORMED INTO A PIT WAS FILLED WITH A RAGGED AND ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
THE GLORY OF GWYNPLAINE HAD NOT PASSED LONDON BRIDGE
HE ENTERED HEAVEN ONLY BY THE ARTISTS DOOR
BESIDES THE SMALL FRY THE SWALLOWERS OF SWORDS AND THE GRIMACE MAKERS REAL PERFORMANCES TOOK PLACE ON THE GREEN
THIS HUT IN A CORNER AT THE BACK TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR SERVED AS BEDCHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM TO URSUS AND GWYNPLAINE
IN GWYNPLAINE EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE
THEN I LOOK PERHAPS LIKE WHAT I AM
URSUS WAS THE POET OF THESE MAGICAL REPRESENTATIONS HE WROTE THE PIECES
WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES
URSUS AND HOMO TOOK CHARGE OF EACH OTHER
SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRS AND FETES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE
THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING
ON THE ROOF FROM A TUBE PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE
THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING
UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD OF THOUGHT
THIS GREEN COLOUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX
THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SOW SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS
THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER
THE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS
THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATRE
FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE
PHOEBE COOKED VENUS SCRUBBED THE TEMPLE
A LOFT UNDER THE ARCH OF THE ROOF CONTAINED THE SCENES AND ON OPENING A TRAP DOOR LAMPS APPEARED PRODUCING WONDERS OF LIGHT
URSUS WAS IN EVERYTHING IN THE PIECE IN THE COMPANY IN THE KITCHEN IN THE ORCHESTRA
THIS OPENING LOOKED FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A MOUTH OF HELL IN THE WORDS OF THE ITINERANT PURITAN PREACHERS WHO TURNED AWAY FROM IT WITH HORROR
THE CARAVAN WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS PARTITIONED FROM EACH OTHER
FOR THESE READ FIBI AND VINOS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
WHAT WAS THIS NOTHING
NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RICTUS
GWYNPLAINE WAS A MOUNTEBANK
THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT
THE MANICHAEANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL
IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELLED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMEDITATION
THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIOR
ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULATORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE
THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAID THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY
HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DYED WITH SOME CORROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH
GWYNPLAINE HAD YELLOW HAIR
WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WAS EVERLASTING
HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOT
BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GYMNAST AND AN ATHLETE
SUCH PERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATURE
THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD
ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MANE THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT
BUT IS LAUGHTER A SYNONYM OF JOY
BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENTS TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANAESTHESIA
AN EVERLASTING LAUGH
IT WAS GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF
HE SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM
ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGGRAVATED IT
IT IS NONSENSE SAID PHOEBE A LITTLE IMPATIENTLY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT A PICTURE WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
I TURN UP THE EARTH BY WAY OF PASTIME
THE ENCLOSURE HAD FORMERLY BEEN VERY EXTENSIVE BUT WAS NOW CONTRACTED WITHIN SMALL COMPASS AND HEMMED ABOUT PARTLY BY HIGH WOODEN FENCES AND PARTLY BY THE OUTBUILDINGS OF HOUSES THAT STOOD ON ANOTHER STREET
MISS HEPZIBAH I SUPPOSE WILL INTERWEAVE THE FACT WITH HER OTHER TRADITIONS AND SET IT DOWN THAT THE FOWLS KNOW YOU TO BE A PYNCHEON
SHE WAS INDISTINCTLY AWARE HOWEVER THAT THE GAUNT FIGURE OF THE OLD GENTLEWOMAN WAS SITTING IN ONE OF THE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIRS A LITTLE WITHDRAWN FROM THE WINDOW THE FAINT GLEAM OF WHICH SHOWED THE BLANCHED PALENESS OF HER CHEEK TURNED SIDEWAYS TOWARDS A CORNER
OH REJOINED THE DAGUERREOTYPIST BECAUSE LIKE AN OLD LADY'S CUP OF TEA IT IS WATER BEWITCHED
AH BUT THESE HENS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN THESE HENS OF ARISTOCRATIC LINEAGE WOULD SCORN TO UNDERSTAND THE VULGAR LANGUAGE OF A BARN YARD FOWL
THE WHITE DOUBLE ROSEBUSH HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN PROPPED UP ANEW AGAINST THE HOUSE SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SEASON AND A PEAR TREE AND THREE DAMSON TREES WHICH EXCEPT A ROW OF CURRANT BUSHES CONSTITUTED THE ONLY VARIETIES OF FRUIT BORE MARKS OF THE RECENT AMPUTATION OF SEVERAL SUPERFLUOUS OR DEFECTIVE LIMBS
IT IS LIKE A BANDAGE OVER ONE'S EYES TO COME INTO IT
SINCE YOU ARE A FRIEND OF MY COUSIN HEPZIBAH'S YOU SHOULD ASK HER TO SHOW YOU THE PICTURE
THIS WAS A FOUNTAIN SET ROUND WITH A RIM OF OLD MOSSY STONES AND PAVED IN ITS BED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SORT OF MOSAIC WORK OF VARIOUSLY COLORED PEBBLES
THEY KEPT THEMSELVES ALIVE UNQUESTIONABLY AND LAID NOW AND THEN AN EGG AND HATCHED A CHICKEN NOT FOR ANY PLEASURE OF THEIR OWN BUT THAT THE WORLD MIGHT NOT ABSOLUTELY LOSE WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SO ADMIRABLE A BREED OF FOWLS
I WILL SIT IN THE PARLOR AWHILE AND COLLECT MY THOUGHTS
THE SUN AS YOU SEE TELLS QUITE ANOTHER STORY AND WILL NOT BE COAXED OUT OF IT AFTER HALF A DOZEN PATIENT ATTEMPTS ON MY PART
YET THE ORIGINAL WEARS TO COMMON EYES A VERY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION
HE EXHIBITED A DAGUERREOTYPE MINIATURE IN A MOROCCO CASE
HERE WE HAVE THE MAN SLY SUBTLE HARD IMPERIOUS AND WITHAL COLD AS ICE LOOK AT THAT EYE
PRAY GO TO BED FOR I AM SURE YOU MUST NEED REST
THE DISTINGUISHING MARK OF THE HENS WAS A CREST OF LAMENTABLY SCANTY GROWTH IN THESE LATTER DAYS BUT SO ODDLY AND WICKEDLY ANALOGOUS TO HEPZIBAH'S TURBAN THAT PHOEBE TO THE POIGNANT DISTRESS OF HER CONSCIENCE BUT INEVITABLY WAS LED TO FANCY A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE BETWIXT THESE FORLORN BIPEDS AND HER RESPECTABLE RELATIVE
IT NOW CONTAINED ONLY CHANTICLEER HIS TWO WIVES AND A SOLITARY CHICKEN
PHOEBE MERELY GLANCED AT IT AND GAVE IT BACK
FEWER WORDS THAN BEFORE BUT WITH THE SAME MYSTERIOUS MUSIC IN THEM
THE CHICKEN CREPT THROUGH THE PALES OF THE COOP AND RAN WITH SOME SHOW OF LIVELINESS TO HER FEET WHILE CHANTICLEER AND THE LADIES OF HIS HOUSEHOLD REGARDED HER WITH QUEER SIDELONG GLANCES AND THEN CROAKED ONE TO ANOTHER AS IF COMMUNICATING THEIR SAGE OPINIONS OF HER CHARACTER
PHOEBE WONDERED WHOSE CARE AND TOIL IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT HAD PLANTED THESE VEGETABLES AND KEPT THE SOIL SO CLEAN AND ORDERLY
THERE IS A WONDERFUL INSIGHT IN HEAVEN'S BROAD AND SIMPLE SUNSHINE
AND YET IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE THE BENIGN SMILE OF THE ORIGINAL
AT SOME UNCERTAIN PERIOD IN THE DEPTHS OF NIGHT AND AS IT WERE THROUGH THE THIN VEIL OF A DREAM SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF A FOOTSTEP MOUNTING THE STAIRS HEAVILY BUT NOT WITH FORCE AND DECISION
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE RACE HAD DEGENERATED LIKE MANY A NOBLE RACE BESIDES IN CONSEQUENCE OF TOO STRICT A WATCHFULNESS TO KEEP IT PURE
THESE FEATHERED PEOPLE HAD EXISTED TOO LONG IN THEIR DISTINCT VARIETY A FACT OF WHICH THE PRESENT REPRESENTATIVES JUDGING BY THEIR LUGUBRIOUS DEPORTMENT SEEMED TO BE AWARE
WHILE THUS DISMISSING HER THE MAIDEN LADY STEPT FORWARD KISSED PHOEBE AND PRESSED HER TO HER HEART WHICH BEAT AGAINST THE GIRL'S BOSOM WITH A STRONG HIGH AND TUMULTUOUS SWELL
WELL I DON'T WISH TO SEE IT ANY MORE OBSERVED PHOEBE TURNING AWAY HER EYES IT IS CERTAINLY VERY LIKE THE OLD PORTRAIT
WHILE WE GIVE IT CREDIT ONLY FOR DEPICTING THE MEREST SURFACE IT ACTUALLY BRINGS OUT THE SECRET CHARACTER WITH A TRUTH THAT NO PAINTER WOULD EVER VENTURE UPON EVEN COULD HE DETECT IT
BEES TOO STRANGE TO SAY HAD THOUGHT IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO COME HITHER POSSIBLY FROM THE RANGE OF HIVES BESIDE SOME FARM HOUSE MILES AWAY
SO WISE AS WELL AS ANTIQUE WAS THEIR ASPECT AS TO GIVE COLOR TO THE IDEA NOT MERELY THAT THEY WERE THE DESCENDANTS OF A TIME HONORED RACE BUT THAT THEY HAD EXISTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY EVER SINCE THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES WAS FOUNDED AND WERE SOMEHOW MIXED UP WITH ITS DESTINY
HOW WONDERFULLY RESPONSIVE TO EVERY EMOTION OF THE HUMAN SOUL
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS A MODERN FACE AND ONE WHICH YOU WILL VERY PROBABLY MEET
IF YOU WOULD PERMIT ME SAID THE ARTIST LOOKING AT PHOEBE I SHOULD LIKE TO TRY WHETHER THE DAGUERREOTYPE CAN BRING OUT DISAGREEABLE TRAITS ON A PERFECTLY AMIABLE FACE
IF THE ORIGINAL IS STILL IN THE WORLD I THINK HE MIGHT DEFY THE SUN TO MAKE HIM LOOK STERN AND HARD
I PREFER TO THINK AND SO WOULD MISS HEPZIBAH THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THE FAMILY TONE FOR YOU ARE A PYNCHEON
SO WE WILL BE FELLOW LABORERS SOMEWHAT ON THE COMMUNITY SYSTEM
WHAT AN INSTRUMENT IS THE HUMAN VOICE
HE HELD A HOE IN HIS HAND AND WHILE PHOEBE WAS GONE IN QUEST OF THE CRUMBS HAD BEGUN TO BUSY HIMSELF WITH DRAWING UP FRESH EARTH ABOUT THE ROOTS OF THE TOMATOES
THERE WERE ALSO A FEW SPECIES OF ANTIQUE AND HEREDITARY FLOWERS IN NO VERY FLOURISHING CONDITION BUT SCRUPULOUSLY WEEDED AS IF SOME PERSON EITHER OUT OF LOVE OR CURIOSITY HAD BEEN ANXIOUS TO BRING THEM TO SUCH PERFECTION AS THEY WERE CAPABLE OF ATTAINING
SUMMER SQUASHES ALMOST IN THEIR GOLDEN BLOSSOM CUCUMBERS NOW EVINCING A TENDENCY TO SPREAD AWAY FROM THE MAIN STOCK AND RAMBLE FAR AND WIDE TWO OR THREE ROWS OF STRING BEANS AND AS MANY MORE THAT WERE ABOUT TO FESTOON THEMSELVES ON POLES TOMATOES OCCUPYING A SITE SO SHELTERED AND SUNNY THAT THE PLANTS WERE ALREADY GIGANTIC AND PROMISED AN EARLY AND ABUNDANT HARVEST
THEY HAVE KNOWN ME MUCH LONGER BUT NEVER HONOR ME WITH ANY FAMILIARITY THOUGH HARDLY A DAY PASSES WITHOUT MY BRINGING THEM FOOD
BUT PUT IT ON THE TABLE IN THE CORNER OF THE PASSAGE
SHE DID NOT ALTOGETHER LIKE HIM
MY NAME IS PHOEBE PYNCHEON SAID THE GIRL WITH A MANNER OF SOME RESERVE FOR SHE WAS AWARE THAT HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE DAGUERREOTYPIST OF WHOSE LAWLESS PROPENSITIES THE OLD MAID HAD GIVEN HER A DISAGREEABLE IDEA
IS THERE NOTHING WILD IN THE EYE CONTINUED HOLGRAVE SO EARNESTLY THAT IT EMBARRASSED PHOEBE AS DID ALSO THE QUIET FREEDOM WITH WHICH HE PRESUMED ON THEIR SO RECENT ACQUAINTANCE
MOST OF MY LIKENESSES DO LOOK UNAMIABLE BUT THE VERY SUFFICIENT REASON I FANCY IS BECAUSE THE ORIGINALS ARE SO
THE NARRATIVE IT MAY BE IS WOVEN OF SO HUMBLE A TEXTURE AS TO REQUIRE THIS ADVANTAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO RENDER IT THE MORE DIFFICULT OF ATTAINMENT
IN GOOD FAITH HOWEVER HE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMAGINATIVE TO FLATTER HIMSELF WITH THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF THIS KIND
THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED IT HARDLY WORTH HIS WHILE THEREFORE RELENTLESSLY TO IMPALE THE STORY WITH ITS MORAL AS WITH AN IRON ROD OR RATHER AS BY STICKING A PIN THROUGH A BUTTERFLY THUS AT ONCE DEPRIVING IT OF LIFE AND CAUSING IT TO STIFFEN IN AN UNGAINLY AND UNNATURAL ATTITUDE
IF PERMITTED BY THE HISTORICAL CONNECTION WHICH THOUGH SLIGHT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS PLAN THE AUTHOR WOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE AVOIDED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE
HE TRUSTS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNPARDONABLY OFFENDING BY LAYING OUT A STREET THAT INFRINGES UPON NOBODY'S PRIVATE RIGHTS AND APPROPRIATING A LOT OF LAND WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE OWNER AND BUILDING A HOUSE OF MATERIALS LONG IN USE FOR CONSTRUCTING CASTLES IN THE AIR
WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SPARSE MEADOWS WHICH MADE A DESPERATE EFFORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
A FEW STRAY COWS AND SHEEP WERE ONLY SEEN OCCASIONALLY
WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REPLY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTHY GUIDE
I SHOULD HAVE A VIOLENT ATTACK OF THE CRAMP IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EXERCISE
LITTLE DID I EXPECT HOWEVER THE SPECTACLE WHICH AWAITED US WHEN WE REACHED THE PENINSULA OF SNEFFELS WHERE AGGLOMERATIONS OF NATURE'S RUINS FORM A KIND OF TERRIBLE CHAOS
THEY VERY RARELY SUCCEED IN A GOOD SHOW OF YELLOW
IN ANY CASE I SHALL TRUST RATHER TO MY OWN INTELLIGENCE THAN THEIRS
I THOROUGHLY UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED THE NECESSITY FOR WAITING BEFORE CROSSING THE FJORD FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN THE SEA AT ITS HIGHEST POINT IS IN A STATE OF SLACK WATER
OUR TWO HORSES WITH THE LUGGAGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQUIRING WHIP OR SPUR
IT CONSISTS SIMPLY OF A FEW HOUSES NOT WHAT IN ENGLAND OR GERMANY WE SHOULD CALL A HAMLET
I TOOK OCCASION TO CONSULT THE MAP TO SEE WHERE GARDAR WAS TO BE FOUND
GEOGRAPHERS HAVE DIVIDED IT INTO FOUR PARTS AND WE HAD TO CROSS THE SOUTHWEST QUARTER WHICH IN THE VERNACULAR IS CALLED SUDVESTR FJORDUNGR
ACCUSTOMED AS I HAD BEEN TO THE STEAM FERRY BOATS OF THE ELBE I FOUND THE LONG OARS OF THE BOATMEN BUT SORRY MEANS OF LOCOMOTION
BUT MY UNCLE WAS IN NO HUMOR TO WAIT
AT LENGTH THE STURDY LITTLE PONY SPREADING OUT HIS LEGS IN A STIFF AND LUDICROUS ATTITUDE GOT FROM UNDER THE PROFESSOR'S LEGS AND LEFT HIM STANDING WITH BOTH FEET ON A SEPARATE STONE LIKE THE COLOSSUS OF RHODES
THESE SACRED EDIFICES ARE HOWEVER VERY MUCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE WHO DO WITHOUT WATCHES AND NEVER MISS THEM
I BEGAN TO ENJOY THE EXHILARATING DELIGHT OF TRAVELING A LIFE OF DESIRE GRATIFICATION AND LIBERTY
HANS OUR EXTRAORDINARY GUIDE WENT FIRST WALKING WITH A STEADY RAPID UNVARYING STEP
TO RIDE OVER SALT WATER UPON THE BACK OF A LITTLE HORSE SEEMED TO ME ABSURD
HE SAYS TIDE REPLIED MY UNCLE TRANSLATING THE DANISH WORD FOR MY INFORMATION
MY ARMS ARE RIGHT BUT MY LEGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE STIFF
I COULD NOT HELP SMILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEGS NOW AND THEN TOUCHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOTED CENTAUR
SNOW TEMPEST IMPRACTICABLE ROADS ROCKS ICEBERGS NOTHING STOPS HIM
HERE AND THERE COULD BE SEEN AN ISOLATED FARM SOME SOLITARY BUR OR ICELANDIC HOUSE BUILT OF WOOD EARTH FRAGMENTS OF LAVA LOOKING LIKE BEGGARS ON THE HIGHWAY OF LIFE
A COUNTER ATTACK WAS MADE UPON WOONGA AND HE WAS DRIVEN DEEP INTO THE WILDERNESS WITH GREAT LOSS
BUT EACH WEEK ADDED TO HIS LONELINESS AND HIS LONGINGS FOR MINNETAKI AND HIS FORESTS
THERE WERE TEARS IN THE BOYS EYES WHEN THEY PARTED AND THE MOTHER CRIED FOR THE INDIAN BOY WHO WAS RETURNING TO HIS PEOPLE
THREE WEEKS LATER CAME WABIGOON'S REPLY
WE WILL HUNT WOLVES THE COUNTRY IS ALIVE WITH THEM AND THE GOVERNMENT GIVES A BOUNTY OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY SCALP TAKEN
BUT IN TIME THE END OF IT ALL CAME AND WABI WENT BACK TO THE PRINCESS MOTHER TO MINNETAKI AND TO HIS FORESTS
AT LAST SO DARING DID HE BECOME THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT PLACED A PRICE UPON HIS HEAD AND UPON THOSE OF A NUMBER OF HIS MOST NOTORIOUS FOLLOWERS
WHILE THE ATTACK WAS SUCCESSFUL IN A WAY ITS MAIN PURPOSE FAILED
WABI ON THE OTHER HAND WAS AN INDIAN IN APPEARANCE FROM HIS MOCCASINS TO THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD SWARTHY SINEWY AS AGILE AS A LYNX AND WITH EVERY INSTINCT IN HIM CRYING FOR THE LIFE OF THE WILD
THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO LOSE IN MAKING PREPARATIONS AND THE FOURTH DAY FOLLOWING THE RECEIPT OF WABI'S LETTER FOUND ROD AND HIS MOTHER WAITING FOR THE TRAIN WHICH WAS TO WHIRL THE BOY INTO HIS NEW LIFE
FROM THAT HOUR DATED ONE OF THE MOST SANGUINARY FEUDS IN THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT TRADING COMPANY A FEUD WHICH AS WE SHALL SEE WAS DESTINED TO LIVE EVEN UNTO THE SECOND GENERATION
IT WAS AT ABOUT THIS TIME IN THEIR LIVES THAT THE WOONGAS BECAME ESPECIALLY DARING IN THEIR DEPREDATIONS
THE CHILDREN PROVED THEMSELVES UNUSUALLY BRIGHT PUPILS AND BY THE TIME WABI WAS SIXTEEN AND MINNETAKI TWELVE ONE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN FROM THEIR MANNER OF SPEECH THAT INDIAN BLOOD RAN IN THEIR VEINS
THREE DAYS LATER MINNETAKI BECAME NEWSOME'S WIFE AT THE HUDSON BAY POST
ON THE TENTH OF OCTOBER HE WOULD MEET ROD AT SPRUCEWOOD ON THE BLACK STURGEON RIVER
CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE BLOOD OF WABI RAN ALMOST PURE TO HIS INDIAN FOREFATHERS WHILE MINNETAKI AS SHE BECAME OLDER DEVELOPED LESS OF THE WILD BEAUTY OF HER MOTHER AND MORE OF THE SOFTER LOVELINESS OF THE WHITE RACE HER WEALTH OF SOFT JET BLACK HAIR AND HER GREAT DARK EYES CONTRASTING WITH THE LIGHTER SKIN OF HER FATHER'S BLOOD
CONSEQUENTLY BOTH MOTHER AND FATHER BEGAN THEIR EDUCATION AT THE POST THEY WERE SENT TO THE FACTOR'S SCHOOL AND TWO WINTERS WERE PASSED IN PORT ARTHUR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THOROUGHLY EQUIPPED SCHOOLS
THE OTHER WAS A GIRL THREE YEARS YOUNGER AND NEWSOME INSISTED THAT SHE BE CALLED MINNETAKI
MEANWHILE TWO CHILDREN CAME TO BLESS THE HAPPY UNION OF NEWSOME AND HIS LOVELY INDIAN WIFE
ONE OF NEWSOME'S CHIEF PLEASURES IN LIFE HAD BEEN THE EDUCATING OF HIS WOODLAND BRIDE AND IT WAS THE AMBITION OF BOTH THAT THE LITTLE MINNETAKI AND HER BROTHER BE REARED IN THE WAYS OF WHITE CHILDREN
A THOUSAND PLANS WERE MADE A THOUSAND ADVENTURES PICTURED AND THE MOTHER WOULD SMILE AND LAUGH AND PLAN WITH THEM
ONE DARK NIGHT AT THE HEAD OF A SCORE OF HIS TRIBE HE FELL UPON WABIGOON'S CAMP HIS OBJECT BEING THE ABDUCTION OF THE PRINCESS
WE SHALL MAKE MORE MONEY UP HERE THIS WINTER THAN YOU COULD EARN IN DETROIT IN THREE YEARS
SPRING CAME AND PASSED AND THEN SUMMER
BUT THIS POWER OF DISCERNMENT WAS DENIED THEM AND ONLY IN AFTER YEARS WITH THE LOVED ONES OF THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CLOSE ABOUT THEM WAS THE WHOLE PICTURE REVEALED
NECESSITY HAD BECOME HIS GRIM MASTER AND THE FOLLOWING WEEK HE WAS GOING TO WORK
THE MEN APPEARED ROBUST BUT HEAVY FAIR HAIRED LIKE GERMANS BUT OF PENSIVE MIEN EXILES OF A HIGHER SCALE IN THE LADDER OF HUMANITY THAN THE ESKIMOS BUT I THOUGHT MUCH MORE UNHAPPY SINCE WITH SUPERIOR PERCEPTIONS THEY ARE COMPELLED TO LIVE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE POLAR CIRCLE
NEARLY THE WHOLE POPULATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LAND
AT ALL EVENTS WE SHALL GET THERE SOME DAY
NO MISTER HARDWIGG SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
ON ALL SIDES WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOLS OF WHALES AND SHARKS
I SAW BUT FEW INHABITANTS DURING MY EXCURSION BUT I MET A CROWD ON THE BEACH DRYING SALTING AND LOADING CODFISH THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF EXPORTATION
WHEN THEREFORE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF HORACE WE AT ONCE CAME TO UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
BUT IN THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE MEN ARE EXPECTED TO SUFFER
I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONSULT THEM
VERY LIKELY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MANUSCRIPTS FROM THE HAND OF SAKNUSSEMM
ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRECIOUS CARGO OF LUGGAGE WAS TAKEN ON BOARD THE GOOD SHIP VALKYRIE
THIS MODEST SCHOLAR SPOKE NO LANGUAGES SAVE ICELANDIC AND LATIN
MY UNCLE WAS DELIGHTED FOR MYSELF MOODY AND DISSATISFIED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GLIMPSE OF THE GHOST OF HAMLET
THE PROFESSOR KNEW WHOM HE HAD TO DEAL WITH
THOUGH NOT VERY LARGE IT APPEARED NOT LIKELY TO BE FILLED FOR CENTURIES
IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS NOT AN HOUR TO LOSE
NOW HARRY SAID MY UNCLE RUBBING HIS HANDS AN GOES WELL THE WORSE DIFFICULTY IS NOW OVER
THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABSENT ON DUTY
HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A CIVIL SERVANT A MAGISTRATE THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND BARON TRAMPE
WELL AND HAVE WE A FAIR WIND
THANKS TO THE HEAT OF THESE RESIDENCES GRASS GROWS ON THE ROOF WHICH GRASS IS CAREFULLY CUT FOR HAY
THE VALKYRIE KEPT OFF THE COAST STEERING TO THE WESTWARD
THE FACT IS THE CASTLE IS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HEROIC PRINCE OF DENMARK
THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS FROWNED DARKLY AND DESCENDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AWAITED US
THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCELY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECTED SOME GOODS BY THE PERIODICAL VESSEL
BUT NO GHOST OR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE ANCIENT WALLS
ON THE ELEVENTH DAY WE SIGHTED CAPE PORTLAND OVER WHICH TOWERED MOUNT MYRDALS YOKUL WHICH THE WEATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READILY
I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WINDS ITS RED TILES WERE BLOWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANNOYANCE OF THE PASTOR AND CONGREGATION
HE WAS OF A CLEAN SAVING DISPOSITION AND HAD ALREADY PAID A NUMBER OF MONTHLY INSTALMENTS ON TWO LOTS FAR OUT ON THE WEST SIDE
SHE WANTED TO MAKE SOME REFERENCE TO THEIR RELATIONS UPON THE TRAIN BUT WAS TOO TIMID
NARROW BOARD WALKS EXTENDED OUT PASSING HERE A HOUSE AND THERE A STORE AT FAR INTERVALS EVENTUALLY ENDING ON THE OPEN PRAIRIE
IT WAS UNDER SUCH AUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SHE STARTED OUT THIS MORNING TO LOOK FOR WORK
SHE ASKED MINNIE FOR INK AND PAPER WHICH WERE UPON THE MANTEL IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN THE LATTER HAD GONE TO BED AT TEN GOT OUT DROUET'S CARD AND WROTE HIM
TO HIM THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HIS WIFE'S SISTER WAS A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE
ONE COULD SEE THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN HIS OFFSPRING
SHE HAD SOME SLIGHT GIFT OF OBSERVATION AND THAT SENSE SO RICH IN EVERY WOMAN INTUITION
YOU COULD GET HOME EASY TOO IT ISN'T VERY FAR
MINNIE BEGAN TO EXPLAIN BUT HER HUSBAND TOOK THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO HIMSELF
HIS AMBITION WAS SOME DAY TO BUILD A HOUSE ON THEM
THEN SHE WALKED AND SANG TO IT UNTIL HANSON DISTURBED IN HIS READING CAME AND TOOK IT
HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE
THE FLOORS WERE COVERED WITH MATTING AND THE HALL LAID WITH A THIN RAG CARPET
THE WALLS OF THE ROOMS WERE DISCORDANTLY PAPERED
NOW NOW HE SAID WALKING THERE THERE AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN SWEDISH ACCENT NOTICEABLE IN HIS VOICE
A SHOP GIRL WAS THE DESTINY PREFIGURED FOR THE NEWCOMER
TO CARRIE THE SOUND OF THE LITTLE BELLS UPON THE HORSE CARS AS THEY TINKLED IN AND OUT OF HEARING WAS AS PLEASING AS IT WAS NOVEL
THESE VAST BUILDINGS WHAT WERE THEY
IT GAVE AN IMPOSING APPEARANCE TO MOST OF THE WHOLESALE HOUSES WHOSE OFFICES WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR AND IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE STREET
MINNIE'S FLAT AS THE ONE FLOOR RESIDENT APARTMENTS WERE THEN BEING CALLED WAS IN A PART OF WEST VAN BUREN STREET INHABITED BY FAMILIES OF LABOURERS AND CLERKS MEN WHO HAD COME AND WERE STILL COMING WITH THE RUSH OF POPULATION POURING IN AT THE RATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR
ANYTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH SO LONG AS IT PAID SAY FIVE DOLLARS A WEEK TO BEGIN WITH
NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING
ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THEREIN ENACTED
DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIVORCE AND ALIMONY
ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE BROODED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RESORT FROM CARRIE AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE IOTA
HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
THREE O'CLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER
IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS LIFE
VERY TRULY YOURS ET CETERA COMPROMISE
IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE BOY RETURNED
HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE
HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCHMAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED
IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING
ANY ANSWER I GUESS NOT
HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STOOD AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER
HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PANACEA FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM
IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T SEND IT
FOR RELIEF HE AROSE AND JOINED IN CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING
IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN ENVELOPE PLACED IN IT THE REQUESTED AMOUNT AND SLOWLY SEALED IT UP
HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CARRIE BUT WHEN HE GOT IN OGDEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY
THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUSINGS
HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED AT HIS PERFIDY
ON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMES AND HAY IT READ
HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE
HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE
HE WAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT
THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE
YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE ENVELOPE AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY
SHE WOULD TAKE THE ENVELOPE AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED
HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY TO EVERYBODY
HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMPLICATIONS
HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANWHILE HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK
WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER
THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE GLOOM OF DEFEAT
SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
IF HE DIDN'T GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SUE HIM PROMPTLY
HE SAW A BUSY SATURDAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH IN AND NOTHING DONE
HE COULD HARDLY REALISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT
HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR WRITE HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THIS SUBJECT
HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DECIDED UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP
BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KEENLY ALIVE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF HIS SITUATION AND WISHED OVER AND OVER THAT SOME SOLUTION WOULD OFFER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT
FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS RELIEVED WHEN ALL THE ENVELOPES HAD BEEN SCANNED AND NOTHING SUSPICIOUS NOTICED
HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS UMBRELLA
SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY THIS MORNING
HOW WOULD THE PAPERS TALK ABOUT IT
MANY LITTLE WRINKLES GATHERED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONTEMPLATED THIS AND HIS BROW MOISTENED
HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROBABLY BE ON HIS DESK WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE
HE WOULD HAVE SOME ARRANGEMENT OF THIS THING
WHILE THE DANGER HAD NOT LESSENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MATERIALISED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS
THEN HE RANG THE BELL NO ANSWER
HE AROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET
AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAITING AND DREARILY HEADED FOR THE MADISON CAR
HURSTWOOD WALKED THE FLOOR MENTALLY ARRANGING THE CHIEF POINTS OF HIS SITUATION
LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISCRETION ASSERTED ITSELF
HE RANG AGAIN THIS TIME HARDER STILL NO ANSWER
HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO WRITE BUT FOUR WORDS IN REPLY GO TO THE DEVIL
BUT HE COMPROMISED BY TELLING THE BOY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REPLY
SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CLIMAX WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SIT IDLE
HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION
HE WENT IN AND EXAMINED HIS LETTERS BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CARRIE
HE WAS IN A FEVERED STATE OF MIND OWING TO THE BLIGHT HIS WIFE'S ACTION THREATENED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE FUTURE
FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOTHING FROM HIS WIFE EITHER
THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND GAZED WITHOUT SEEING CONTEMPLATING THE RESULT OF HIS WORK
WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THE CONFOUNDED WRETCH
AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO RECTOR'S FOR LUNCH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A MESSENGER WAS WAITING FOR HIM
HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY HER THE MONEY WHICH SHE WOULD NOW REGULARLY DEMAND OR THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HE DID
HE BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY PERHAPS HE COULD DO IT UP HERE
THE LONG DRIZZLE HAD BEGUN PEDESTRIANS HAD TURNED UP COLLARS AND TROUSERS AT THE BOTTOM
HE COULD ARRANGE THAT SATISFACTORILY FOR CARRIE WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY
SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DROUET THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO HIM TO WORRY ABOUT HIS FINDING OUT
HE GREW RESTLESS AS HE RUMINATED AND THEN DECIDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING
HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MORROW AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO MEET AS USUAL
HURSTWOOD ALMOST EXCLAIMED OUT LOUD AT THE INSISTENCY OF THIS THING
HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANYHOW HE WOULD HAVE NO ROW
I DID NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND IT
A VOICE INQUIRED WHO'S THERE
THERE WAS A TRAP AT THE BOY AND BLUNDERBUSS BUT THAT REQUIRED FETCHING
I TOLLED THE BELL AGAIN
WE'VE LOST THE KEY OF THE CELLAR AND THERE'S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON'T THINK YOU'D CARE FOR THAT
HE WAS IMPERVIOUS TO REASON
IT APPEARED THAT THE TERMS WOULD BE FIVE GUINEAS BUT THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT FEE WOULD COVER
THE REPLY WAS WRITTEN IN A SPRAWLING FEMININE HAND IT WAS A LITTLE VAGUE
IT WAS A HORRIBLE JOURNEY
WHO LIVES HERE ARE THE PEOPLE MAD
NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE AND HANGAR DENE THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEPS WERE BENT ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PLOUGHED FIELDS MY INFORMANT DID NOT MENTION
PRESENTLY FEET WERE HEARD ADVANCING ALONG THE PASSAGE SEVERAL PAIRS IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GLEAMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
THERE APPEARED TO BE NO KNOCKER THOUGH WHETHER IT HAD BEEN TWISTED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SAY
I EVEN BOUGHT SOMETHING FOR MADGE I MEAN MISSUS WILSON
THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOMMODATION WHICH WOULD BE PROVIDED NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MAINTAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT
I HAD LONG BEEN WISHING THAT AN OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMAS HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EXTINCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADVENTURING IN QUEST OF ONE
THE BELL REVERBERATED THROUGH WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN EMPTY HOUSE
I HAD NO ILLUSIONS
UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKELY TO BE LIVELY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MADGE AND IT WAS THE ACCIDENT OF HER CHRISTIAN NAME WHICH DECIDED ME TO GO
MAYBE THEY'RE UP TO SOME OF THEIR GAMES AND WANTS ROUSING
I WAS CHILLED TO THE BONE WET TIRED HUNGRY
THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRIFLE ODD
I FELT QUITE LIVELY MYSELF AS I MINGLED WITH THE CHRISTMAS CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABSOLUTELY PREPOSTEROUS
THERE'S A KNOCKER IF NONE OF EM HAVEN'T TWISTED IT OFF
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MADGE AND YET FROM MY BOYHOOD UPWARD I HAVE DESIRED TO MEET ONE
ALL NIGHT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING AND RAINING
BETTER RING AGAIN SUGGESTED THE DRIVER HARD
THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEPS IF YOU CAN FIND EM
HERE WE BE THAT MIGHT BE SO
NO ANSWER THOUGH I ALLOWED A MORE THAN DECENT INTERVAL
I DID NOT EXPECT A PRINCELY ENTERTAINMENT
NOW IT IS A REMARKABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY PREDILECTION FOR THE NAME MADGE I DO NOT KNOW WHY
THERE WAS A RUSH OF RETREATING FEET AN EXPOSTULATING VOICE THEN DARKNESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
IN IT I WAS DEPOSITED WITH MY LUGGAGE
FESTIVE YES
WHEN AT LAST I REACHED CROFTON MY JOURNEY'S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE STATION STAFF CONSISTED OF A HALF WITTED INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STATIONMASTER PORTER AND CLERK COMBINED AND A HULKING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THERE WAS TO DO
AFTER A VAST AMOUNT OF UNFASTENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THRESHOLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHTED CANDLE IN HER HAND
I'M MISTER CHRISTOPHER FROM LONDON
IT IS SOME SATISFACTION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REFLECT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE OFFICIALS HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF
I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP IN MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FESTIVE SEASON
WHEN THE TRAP DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UNCOMMONLY LIKE AN OPEN SPRING CART
THE INFORMATION WAS GREETED WITH WHAT SOUNDED UNCOMMONLY LIKE A CHORUS OF LAUGHTER
BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD PITY ME I ALTOGETHER FAIL TO UNDERSTAND
AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SHIRKING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER
I GASPED POSITIVELY GASPED
SHE HAS A KNACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISHES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANTS WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF MIRACULOUS
IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE'S WEDDING SO UNIMPORTANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SET TO PLAY IN IT
I WAS PERSUADED THAT SOMEBODY BESIDES THAT COUSIN GOT A PROFIT OUT OF MARY ANN'S ENGAGEMENT RING BUT I HANDED OVER THE AMOUNT
IT IS FROM HER ACTION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUSPICION SPRINGS
FOR INSTANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEHAVIOUR IN THE MATTER OF THE RING
I NOTICE THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PERSONS WHO HAVE ALREADY TENDERED THEIR OFFERINGS
THAT'S IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT
I HAVE DRAWN UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON'T BE MY FAULT IF I DON'T GET IT
WE HAVE ALL BEEN GIVING MARY ANN PRESENTS AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WHITING HAVE BEEN GIVING HER SOMETHING TOO
AS IT IS UNLESS I AM MISTAKEN SOME OF THE RENDING WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT ALL MARY ANN'S THINGS HAD BEEN ALREADY BOUGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MARKED
THERE SHE OWNS A COTTAGE OR IT MAY BE A PIGSTYE FOR ALL I KNOW
BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SELL THE COUPONS AND RAILWAY PASSES WHICH WE DON'T USE
THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MACPHERSON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY
A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN A BUSH' AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US
IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECTATIONS AND SHE HAD HERS
I KNOW WHAT MAMMA CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE SHE GIVES IT
AND WHAT INQUIRED MISSUS MACPHERSON HAS MARY ANN GIVEN YOU HER LOVE
HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASSES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR JOURNEY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND COUPONS FOR FREE BOARD AND LODGING AT THE HOTEL IT'S A WEDDING PRESENT
WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENGAGEMENT WITH MARY ANN SHE WROTE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPEND OUR HONEYMOON IN HER COTTAGE OR PIGSTYE AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RENT FOR IT
IT IS MOST DELIGHTFUL
P S THE CARDS ARE OUT FOR THE WEDDING
A SECOND COUSIN OF MARY ANN'S IS IN THE COOK'S TOURS LINE
THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FALTERING ABOUT HER FLOW OF LANGUAGE
HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARKABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST
IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MANAGE MOST COMFORTABLY DELIGHTFULLY IN FACT
SOMEONE SNIGGERED
I CANNOT PRETEND TO EXPLAIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT ROMANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRCLE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH THE SNELLINGS MOVE
I SHALL MAKE PAPA GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS AT LEAST
BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY WEDDING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SNELLINGS
I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECTATIONS
WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HONEYMOON TO ITALY AND THE SOUTH OF FRANCE
OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN'T BE PERFECTLY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE'S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING
THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARY ANN A WEDDING PRESENT SEEMS TO FILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RANCOROUS ACIDITY WHICH TO ME IS INEXPLICABLE
FROM A COUSIN OF OURS WHO'S IN THAT LINE
THE ACCIDENT IN QUESTION OCCURRED UPON THE SUNDAY EVENING
THE GIRL IS FRETTING BUT YOU DON'T SEEM TO NOTICE IT
I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SNELLINGS FOR POSSESSING RELATIVES IN ALL SORTS OF LINES
SUCH IS THE SELFISHNESS OF HUMAN NATURE
HERS HAS BEEN PRODIGIOUS
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS B EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOZZLE IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOZZLE TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD
OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOZZLE
AND ALL WORK HAD CEASED WITH HIM
AND BOZZLE AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE
AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GAIT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
A DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TREVELYAN ON TREVELYAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED AGAIN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TREVELYAN
THEN BOZZLE CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE
IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBOROUGH SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES
DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELYAN
IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOZZLE TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
BOZZLE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
BOZZLE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL
TREVELYAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD B
AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOUR
MISSUS BOZZLE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
BUT TREVELYAN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS
IT'S THAT AS MAKES EM I WON'T SAY WHAT
I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
HE CAN'T SUCKLE EM CAN HE
IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKINT SIR SUGGESTED BOZZLE
I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TREVELYAN
AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BOZZLE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK
THE PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOZZLE'S LAW
HE'S UP IN TOWN SIR A MINDING OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
DRAT EM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS
MISSUS BOZZLE WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY FEARS FOR HER WHEN ABROAD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLAMOUR OF HER RETURN
NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THIS ROOM THIS EVENING
AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS HORTON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUTIFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILNER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA
MISSUS HORTON TOO IN THE SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE
MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE GINGLE OF A TEA SPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET
DORRIFORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARDONED
IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW
YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE
IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY
MISS MILNER YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR
ON THIS HE ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND GOING TO HER SAID ONCE MORE SHEW YOUR SUBMISSION BY OBEYING ME A SECOND TIME TO DAY
I THOUGHT MISS MILNER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MILNER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL
IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HER'S
I HOPE MISS MILNER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT SHE DESISTED
NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFICIOUS LABOURS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSTLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE
DORRIFORTH THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN
WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOUR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPREST
HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TILL MISSUS HORTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING
MISSUS HORTON ROSE FROM HER SEAT MOVED THE DECANTERS AND FRUIT ROUND THE TABLE STIRRED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK TO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED
YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT
AND HE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR
KEEP YOUR APPOINTMENT AND BE ASSURED THAT I SHALL ISSUE MY COMMANDS WITH MORE CIRCUMSPECTION FOR THE FUTURE AS I FIND HOW STRICTLY THEY ARE COMPLIED WITH
FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM
AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DORRIFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND
EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS
HE COUGHED DRANK HIS TEA ENDEAVOURED TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES READ AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MILNER CAME INTO THE ROOM NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL BUT AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER
MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM
SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH DORRIFORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HORTON THAT LORD FREDERICK'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION
MISS WOODLEY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED
TO SYNESIUS'S MOST CHARMING LETTERS AS WELL AS TO THOSE OF ISIDORE THE GOOD ABBOT OF PELUSIUM I BEG LEAVE TO REFER THOSE READERS WHO WISH FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIVATE LIFE OF THE FIFTH CENTURY
THAT DIVINE WORD WHO IS THE LIGHT WHO LIGHTETH EVERY MAN WHICH COMETH INTO THE WORLD HAD AWAKENED IN THE HEART OF MANKIND A MORAL CRAVING NEVER BEFORE FELT IN ANY STRENGTH EXCEPT BY A FEW ISOLATED PHILOSOPHERS OR PROPHETS
THE COUNTLESS TREASURES WHICH FIVE CENTURIES OF RAPINE HAD ACCUMULATED ROUND THE CAPITOL HAD BECOME THE PREY OF MEN CLOTHED IN SHEEPSKINS AND HORSE HIDE AND THE SISTER OF AN EMPEROR HAD FOUND HER BEAUTY VIRTUE AND PRIDE OF RACE WORTHILY MATCHED BY THOSE OF THE HARD HANDED NORTHERN HERO WHO LED HER AWAY FROM ITALY AS HIS CAPTIVE AND HIS BRIDE TO FOUND NEW KINGDOMS IN SOUTH FRANCE AND SPAIN AND TO DRIVE THE NEWLY ARRIVED VANDALS ACROSS THE STRAITS OF GIBRALTAR INTO THE THEN BLOOMING COAST LAND OF NORTHERN AFRICA
HOW INIQUITOUS WAS THE CONDUCT OF THE SONS OF THEODOSIUS IN REFUSING THE USUAL BOUNTY BY WHICH THE GOTHS WERE BRIBED NOT TO ATTACK THE EMPIRE THE WHOLE PENT UP DELUGE BURST OVER THE PLAINS OF ITALY AND THE WESTERN EMPIRE BECAME FROM THAT DAY FORTH A DYING IDIOT WHILE THE NEW INVADERS DIVIDED EUROPE AMONG THEMSELVES
NOT BE IT EVER REMEMBERED THAT THE SLIGHTEST SUSPICION OF IMMORALITY ATTACHES EITHER TO THE HEROINE OF THIS BOOK OR TO THE LEADING PHILOSOPHERS OF HER SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL CENTURIES
THAT WONDERFUL METAPHYSIC SUBTLETY WHICH IN PHRASES AND DEFINITIONS TOO OFTEN UNMEANING TO OUR GROSSER INTELLECT SAW THE SYMBOLS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SPIRITUAL REALITIES AND FELT THAT ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOMOOUSIOS AND HOMOIOUSIOS MIGHT HANG THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF HUMANITY WAS SET TO BATTLE IN ALEXANDRIA THE ANCIENT STRONGHOLD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY WITH THE EFFETE REMAINS OF THE VERY SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT TO WHICH IT OWED ITS EXTRAORDINARY CULTURE
JULIAN'S LAST ATTEMPT TO RESTORE PAGANISM BY IMPERIAL INFLUENCE HAD ONLY PROVED THAT THE OLD FAITH HAD LOST ALL HOLD UPON THE HEARTS OF THE MASSES AT HIS DEATH THE GREAT TIDE WAVE OF NEW OPINION ROLLED ON UNCHECKED AND THE RULERS OF EARTH WERE FAIN TO SWIM WITH THE STREAM TO ACCEPT IN WORDS AT LEAST THE CHURCH'S LAWS AS THEIRS TO ACKNOWLEDGE A KING OF KINGS TO WHOM EVEN THEY OWED HOMAGE AND OBEDIENCE AND TO CALL THEIR OWN SLAVES THEIR POORER BRETHREN AND OFTEN TOO THEIR SPIRITUAL SUPERIORS
THE HUNS SINGLY THEIR INFERIORS PRESSED THEM FROM BEHIND WITH THE IRRESISTIBLE WEIGHT OF NUMBERS ITALY WITH HER RICH CITIES AND FERTILE LOWLANDS BECKONED THEM ON TO PLUNDER AS AUXILIARIES THEY HAD LEARNED THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND ROMAN WEAKNESS A CASUS BELLI WAS SOON FOUND
BUT THE HEALTH OF A CHURCH DEPENDS NOT MERELY ON THE CREED WHICH IT PROFESSES NOT EVEN ON THE WISDOM AND HOLINESS OF A FEW GREAT ECCLESIASTICS BUT ON THE FAITH AND VIRTUE OF ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS
THEY BROUGHT BEFORE THE MINDS OF CHURCHMEN A THOUSAND NEW QUESTIONS WHICH MUST BE SOLVED UNLESS THE CHURCH WAS TO RELINQUISH FOR EVER HER CLAIMS AS THE GREAT TEACHER AND SATISFIER OF THE HUMAN SOUL
TRIBE AFTER TRIBE WAS CROWDING DOWN TO THE ALPS AND TRAMPLING UPON EACH OTHER ON THE FRONTIERS OF THE EMPIRE
THE VERY EMPERORS HAD ARRAYED THEMSELVES ON HER SIDE
AND THE NEW BLOOD AT THE ERA OF THIS STORY WAS AT HAND
IN THE MEANWHILE THE MINDS OF MEN CUT ADRIFT FROM THEIR ANCIENT MOORINGS WANDERED WILDLY OVER PATHLESS SEAS OF SPECULATIVE DOUBT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MORE METAPHYSICAL AND CONTEMPLATIVE EAST ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE FOR THEMSELVES THE QUESTIONS OF MAN'S RELATION TO THE UNSEEN BY THOSE THOUSAND SCHISMS HERESIES AND THEOSOPHIES IT IS A DISGRACE TO THE WORD PHILOSOPHY TO CALL THEM BY IT ON THE RECORDS OF WHICH THE STUDENT NOW GAZES BEWILDERED UNABLE ALIKE TO COUNT OR TO EXPLAIN THEIR FANTASIES
BUT IF THE EMPERORS HAD BECOME CHRISTIAN THE EMPIRE HAD NOT
THE MENS SANA MUST HAVE A CORPUS SANUM TO INHABIT
CLIMATE BAD EXAMPLE AND THE LUXURY OF POWER DEGRADED THEM IN ONE CENTURY INTO A RACE OF HELPLESS AND DEBAUCHED SLAVE HOLDERS DOOMED TO UTTER EXTERMINATION BEFORE THE SEMI GOTHIC ARMIES OF BELISARIUS AND WITH THEM VANISHED THE LAST CHANCE THAT THE GOTHIC RACES WOULD EXERCISE ON THE EASTERN WORLD THE SAME STERN YET WHOLESOME DISCIPLINE UNDER WHICH THE WESTERN HAD BEEN RESTORED TO LIFE
IN THE PRESENT CASE THAT DISADVANTAGE IS DOUBLED FOR WHILE THE SINS OF THE CHURCH HOWEVER HEINOUS WERE STILL SUCH AS ADMIT OF BEING EXPRESSED IN WORDS THE SINS OF THE HEATHEN WORLD AGAINST WHICH SHE FOUGHT WERE UTTERLY INDESCRIBABLE AND THE CHRISTIAN APOLOGIST IS THUS COMPELLED FOR THE SAKE OF DECENCY TO STATE THE CHURCH'S CASE FAR MORE WEAKLY THAN THE FACTS DESERVE
ONE WHO WRITES OF SUCH AN ERA LABOURS UNDER A TROUBLESOME DISADVANTAGE
THAT EXTRAORDINARY REFORM IN MORALS WHICH ACCORDING TO SALVIAN AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES THE VANDAL CONQUERORS WORKED IN NORTH AFRICA AVAILED THEM NOTHING THEY LOST MORE THAN THEY GAVE
I CANNOT HOPE THAT THESE PAGES WILL BE ALTOGETHER FREE FROM ANACHRONISMS AND ERRORS
THE ROOM HAD NEITHER CARPET NOR FIREPLACE AND THE ONLY MOVABLES IN IT WERE A SOFA BED A TABLE AND AN ARM CHAIR ALL OF SUCH DELICATE AND GRACEFUL FORMS AS MAY BE SEEN ON ANCIENT VASES OF A FAR EARLIER PERIOD THAN THAT WHEREOF WE WRITE
AND WHY SHOULD THAT DISTURB ME LET HIM ENTER
THE PLACE SEEMED FRAGRANT WITH ALL THE RICHES OF GREEK THOUGHT AND SONG SINCE THE DAYS WHEN PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS WALKED THERE WITH EUCLID AND THEOCRITUS CALLIMACHUS AND LYCOPHRON
I TO BELIEVE AGAINST THE AUTHORITY OF PORPHYRY HIMSELF TOO IN EVIL EYES AND MAGIC
THERE IS FRUIT WITH LENTILS AND RICE WAITING FOR YOU IN THE NEXT ROOM AND BREAD UNLESS YOU DESPISE IT TOO MUCH
AY SHE ANSWERED HALF BITTERLY AND WOULD THAT WE COULD LIVE WITHOUT FOOD AND IMITATE PERFECTLY THE IMMORTAL GODS
TO BE WELCOMED INTO THE CELESTIAL RANKS OF THE HEROIC TO RISE TO THE IMMORTAL GODS TO THE INEFFABLE POWERS ONWARD UPWARD EVER THROUGH AGES AND THROUGH ETERNITIES TILL I FIND MY HOME AT LAST AND VANISH IN THE GLORY OF THE NAMELESS AND THE ABSOLUTE ONE
HOW CAN HE WHOSE SPHERE LIES ABOVE THE STARS STOOP EVERY MOMENT TO EARTH
NOT THAT SUCH A CREATURE AS THAT DISTURBS ME NO CREATED THING I HOPE CAN MOVE MY EQUANIMITY BUT IF I COULD STOOP TO HATE I SHOULD HATE HER HATE HER
IF THEY HAVE CAST OFF THE VULGAR HERD THEY HAVE NOT CAST OFF HYPATIA
IF THEY HAVE CEASED TO GUIDE NATIONS THEY HAVE NOT CEASED TO SPEAK TO THEIR OWN ELECT
STRANGE THAT MEN SHOULD BE CONTENT TO GROVEL AND BE MEN WHEN THEY MIGHT RISE TO THE RANK OF GODS
WHAT DO I CARE FOR FOOD
HIS EXCELLENCY MADAM THE PREFECT
SHE HAS LIFTED HER EYES OFF HER MANUSCRIPT SHE IS LOOKING OUT WITH KINDLING COUNTENANCE OVER THE GARDENS OF THE MUSEUM HER RIPE CURLING GREEK LIPS SUCH AS WE NEVER SEE NOW EVEN AMONG HER OWN WIVES AND SISTERS OPEN
BUT MOST PROBABLY HAD ANY OF US ENTERED THAT ROOM THAT MORNING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPARE A LOOK EITHER FOR THE FURNITURE OR THE GENERAL EFFECT OR THE MUSEUM GARDENS OR THE SPARKLING MEDITERRANEAN BEYOND BUT WE SHOULD HAVE AGREED THAT THE ROOM WAS QUITE RICH ENOUGH FOR HUMAN EYES FOR THE SAKE OF ONE TREASURE WHICH IT POSSESSED AND BESIDE WHICH NOTHING WAS WORTH A MOMENT'S GLANCE
AND HER VOICE TOOK A TONE WHICH MADE IT SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN WHETHER IN SPITE OF ALL THE LOFTY IMPASSIBILITY WHICH SHE FELT BOUND TO POSSESS SHE DID NOT HATE PELAGIA WITH A MOST HUMAN AND MUNDANE HATRED
NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE EDITOR CAN SUPPLY
WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT
BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERINE'S REPLY
IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD
CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND
BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW
SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE
HE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING
EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SYDENHAM
SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW
WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE
HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SYDNEY AN INTERVIEW
YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERINE
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED
HONESTLY
WHEN HE AND I HAPPENED TO BE LEFT TOGETHER HE NATURALLY WONDERED AFTER HAVING SEEN THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE WHERE THE LUCKY HUSBAND MIGHT BE
THE NEW NUMBER OF A POPULAR WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD THAT DAY BEEN PUBLISHED RANDAL BOUGHT IT
ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE RANDAL ARRANGED HIS DEPARTURE FOR SYDENHAM SO AS TO ARRIVE AT THE HOTEL AN HOUR BEFORE THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE DINNER
HE WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS NORMAN AND TO MISSUS NORMAN'S LITTLE GIRL AND WE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HIM
BEFORE I CONSENTED TO ANSWER THE CHILD'S INQUIRIES I CAME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH HER MOTHER
BUT IF THESE NEWSPAPER PEOPLE WAITED TO FIND OUT WHETHER A REPORT IS TRUE OR FALSE HOW MUCH GOSSIP WOULD SOCIETY GET IN ITS FAVORITE NEWSPAPERS
HOW NICE OF YOU TO COME SO SOON SHE BEGAN
HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE FOR CAPTAIN BENNYDECK
ARRIVED AT THE STATION RANDAL FOUND THAT HE MUST WAIT FOR THE TRAIN
GOOD BY DEAR RANDAL
A VERY WISE DECISION SHE REMARKED
MISSUS PRESTY WAS AT HOME SHE WAS REPORTED TO BE IN THE GARDEN OF THE HOTEL
THE REPORT IS PREMATURE MY GOOD FRIEND
IT WAS A RELIEF TO RANDAL IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CATHERINE'S RELATIONS TOWARD BENNYDECK TO RETURN TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIS FRIEND
MISSUS NORMAN AND HER LITTLE DAUGHTER WERE OUT DRIVING WITH A FRIEND AND WERE EXPECTED TO RETURN IN GOOD TIME FOR DINNER
SIT DOWN SAID MISSUS PRESTY
RANDAL PASSED THIS OVER WITHOUT NOTICE
BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT WE ARE ONLY HALF AN HOUR BEHIND YOU AT SYDENHAM IN THE MATTER OF NEWS
SHE ADDED LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY
THAT WILL DO MISSUS PRESTY YOUR DEFENSE IS THOROUGHLY WORTHY OF YOUR CONDUCT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS
WHILE HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM WITH A MIND DOUBLY DISTRESSED BY ANXIETY ABOUT HIS BROTHER AND ANXIETY ABOUT SYDNEY THE TRAIN FROM LONDON CAME IN
YOU ARE TO UNDERSTAND THAT CATHERINE IS A WIDOW
WITH HIS OWN SUSPICIONS STEADILY CONTRADICTING HIM HE ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL OBSTINATELY BELIEVING THAT THE CHARMING WIDOW WOULD PROVE TO BE A STRANGER
NOT AT THE HOTEL JUST NOW
SHE ASKED DIRECTLY IF HER FATHER WAS DEAD
WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED I DO ASSURE YOU WORSE STORIES HAVE BEEN PRINTED
RANDAL LOOKED AGAIN AT THE FIRST WORDS IN THE PARAGRAPH
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN HER PINING FOR THE COMPANY OF OTHER CHILDREN AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO MERCY ON HER
YOU SHALL HEAR HOW MY DIVORCED DAUGHTER AND MY POOR LITTLE GRANDCHILD WERE TREATED AT SANDYSEAL AFTER YOU LEFT US
AFTER READING ONE OR TWO OF THE POLITICAL ARTICLES HE ARRIVED AT THE COLUMNS SPECIALLY DEVOTED TO FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE
AND THE CAPTAIN OF COURSE CONCLUDED AFTER HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED TO KITTY THAT MISSUS NORMAN WAS A WIDOW
AFTER THAT I HAD HER MOTHER'S AUTHORITY FOR TELLING KITTY THAT SHE WOULD NEVER SEE HER FATHER AGAIN
AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT
HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION
HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAKUP OF THE FAMILY
LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY
WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER
RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW
WAS HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT
THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER
OH WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS
I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF
NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SYDNEY'S INTERESTS TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB
HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD
LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS FIRST
I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW
I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE
RANDAL WAITED A WHILE IN LONDON ON THE CHANCE THAT BENNYDECK MIGHT PAY HIM A VISIT
THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANDAL
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK
I'M AFRAID HE SAID
YOU CAN'T DO IT
I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER
HAD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM
SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE
HE DRANK THE WINE GREEDILY
YOU DISTRESS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY
I FEEL FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WARMLY
HE IS STAYING AT THIS HOTEL TO TRY THE AIR OF SYDENHAM AND HE FINDS THAT IT AGREES WITH HIM
RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SYDNEY IS
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE
WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST AT ALL EVENTS
SWEETWATER SOMEONE DREW THAT WEAPON OUT
BUT CLEWS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
THERE WAS NO DOUBTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE
GEORGE NODDED
ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE
I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FURTIVE WATCHER
BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWS
THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT
IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE
VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL
THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE
NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST
THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
YES
THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE THERE
NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
BUT I'M IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES
GEORGE
THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR AUNT
MARK SOWERBY AND CLAUS HENNERBERG
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW
THERE WAS NO PONIARD IN THE WOUND
NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL
NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY
YES MISS CLARKE THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARRISHES
I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
YES MISTER SLATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED
AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALLUREMENT FOR HIM
FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY
YES MANY TIMES
HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE
THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
NO DOUBT
WHAT DOES HE WANT
I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY
AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION
SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW
I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY
A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD
HONEST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS
YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
YES HE'S MERCURIAL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN
WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LOBBY
INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE
I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY
THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON
NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING
IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRYCE
HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME
MISS CLARKE STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY
WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GRYCE
JUST AN EVERYDAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOROUGH
THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER
I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND RHEUMATIC INVALID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS
HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT
THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR
BUT VIGOUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARKE AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR
THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
BEEN OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY
OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT
WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW
VERY WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PIONEER ME
I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE
SWEETWATER HELP ME OUT OF THIS
SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE
I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO WAKING
SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SWOOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAKE
THUS WAS SHE BORNE AWAY CAPTIVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER WILLING NOR UNWILLING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS
SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EAR OF A MIST A FUME FROM MY OWN BRAIN
WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BEENIE UNDESIRED HAD KINDLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURAL UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL
HE CAME TO HER SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GREETING
SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANTS SOFT FOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEEDED HER
SHE HAD LOST HIM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM
SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND
THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD RECALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING FROM IT WITH A CRY
BUT LIVING SOUL THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEET
AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TOMBS
BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOWHERE TO GO NOWHERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL
SHE WAS LOST LOST UTTERLY WITH AN ETERNAL LOSS
IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT AT WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLORS AND ODORS
AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED ALIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE AND THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS IT FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE
HER ONLY LIFE WAS THAT SHE WAS LOST
WITH THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN
THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICKER DREAM AND THIS IS TRUER BECAUSE MORE SHADOWY
WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEENIE AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB
THERE IS A SEAT IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE HESITATED
HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOTEL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THEATRE MY MAID A HORRID FRENCH THING WE GOT IN PARIS PACKED UP ALL MY TRUNKS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PAID THE BILL AND WENT
IT WAS PLAIN THAT HIS CASTANET GIRL HIS MOTHER AND SISTER TOOK A PLEASURE IN CREDITING HER DAILY WITH SOME FRESH AND UNPLEASING INSTRUMENT COULD HAVE HAD NEITHER TASTE MONEY NOR HONESTY TO SUCH A POINT AS THIS
HE HURRIEDLY CUT CAKE AND PRESSED IT UPON HER
DO DRINK THIS AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
THE SILVER IS ALL RIGHT THANK GOODNESS SHE SAID BUT YOUR BANJO GIRL HAS TAKEN A PAIR OF YOUR SISTER'S SILK STOCKINGS AND THOSE NEW SHOES OF HERS WITH THE SILVER BUCKLES AND SHE'S LEFT THESE
HER LITTLE FOOT TAPPED THE GRAVEL IMPATIENTLY
NEVER HAD ANY ACT SEEMED SO IMPOSSIBLE
THE LADY AND THE GUITAR CERTAINLY PASSED THE NIGHT AT HILL VIEW VILLA BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER VERY ANGRY AND VERY FRIGHTENED CAME UP WITH HIM AT ABOUT NOON THE HOUSE LOOKED JUST AS USUAL AND NO ONE WAS THERE BUT THE CHARWOMAN
YOU SEE PAPA'S SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT ME TO TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH DUKES AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED
AND AGAIN HE LISTENED WITH A QUIET PLEASURE
WELL THEN I WENT INTO LODGINGS THAT WICKED WOMAN HAD LEFT ME ONE STREET SUIT AND TO DAY THEY TURNED ME OUT BECAUSE MY MONEY WAS ALL GONE
SHE SAID AGAIN YOU ARE KIND
THEN THERE WAS SILENCE THEN A SIGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MOVING FEET ON THE GRAVEL
I WILL CATCH THE NIGHT TRAIN AND BRING MY MOTHER UP TO MORROW THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
YOU ARE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND OUT TO HIM HE DID NOT KISS IT THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY
ALL THE SAME HE ADDED IRRELEVANTLY YOU SHALL HAVE THE LATCH KEY
I SHALL LOCK UP ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHALL GIVE YOU MY LATCH KEY AND YOU CAN LET YOURSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF RELIEF AND LIGHTED THE WAX CANDLES IN THE SOLID SILVER CANDLESTICKS ON HIS WRITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUMMER DUSK WAS FALLING AND THAT ORGAN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE MEASURE OF THE DAY'S APPOINTED TORTURE
THE LAST STRAINS OF THE ILL TREATED ILL FATED INTERMEZZO HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RUMBLING OF THE WHEELS OF THE MURDEROUS BARREL ORGAN THAT HAD SO GAILY EXECUTED THAT ALONG WITH THE NINE OTHER TUNES OF ITS REPERTORY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE HOUSEMAID AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPPOSITE AND THE CROWING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BABIES NEXT DOOR
LET ME THINK HE SAID OH HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU HAPPENED TO COME THIS WAY
IT WASN'T I WHO SAID THAT SAID THE GIRL SMILING BUT THAT'S SO ANYHOW AND THEN SHE SIGHED
IS IT ONLY THAT YOU'RE POOR WHY THAT'S NOTHING I'M POOR TOO SHE LAUGHED
LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NONSENSE YOU KNOW YOU ARE TIRED OUT AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHAT IS IT
THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUARTER INDICATED AND DISAPPEARED ROUND THE LAUREL BUSHES
HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM
SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A POEM A LYRIC IN A WHITE GOWN AND GREEN SCARF COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRASS UNDER THE BLOSSOMED BOUGHS
WHAT OPINION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PURITY OF HER MIND THE INNOCENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INCIDENT LIKE THIS FAILED TO SHOCK HER DEEPLY
COULDN'T HELP IT THEN HOW CAN I EVER TRUST YOU
DO YOU THINK I'M NOT SORRY NOW
FOLLOWING THE TINGLE OF RELIEF CAME A SHARP SICKENING PINCH OF JEALOUSY AND MORTIFICATION THESE INSPIRED HER
HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUEBELLS AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE IN MAIDENLY DEFENCE AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS
AND HE STRODE DOWN BETWEEN THE MARBLE TABLES AND OUT BY THE SWING DOOR IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXIT
THE SETTING OF THE SCENE SEEMED TO HER ALL IMPORTANT
THE KEEN WIND THRUST ITSELF EVEN INSIDE THE HIGH COLLAR OF HER JACKET
HER HANDS AND FEET WERE ACHING WITH COLD
IT WAS BITTERLY COLD BUT THE EMBANKMENT WAS MORE ROMANTIC THAN A RAILWAY CARRIAGE
AT THE CORNER HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAYING FOR THE TEA AND HIS NATURAL IMPULSE WAS TO GO BACK AND REMEDY THAT ERROR
HE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD OFFERED NO EXCUSE NO EXPLANATION
HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY DO YOU MEAN IT
SHE WOULD HAVE SHARED HIS SORROW AND SHOWN HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANGEL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK HOUR
AND CURIOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CURIOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY
HE CHECKED THE SILLY IMPULSE
SO HE ENLISTED AND WENT TO SOUTH AFRICA AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVERED WITH MEDALS AND GLORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIMPLE WORDS OF EXPLANATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REPAID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
SHE ONLY WISHED FOR MAY AND THE ORCHARD INSTEAD OF JANUARY AND THE DINGY DUSTY WAITING ROOM THE PLAIN FACED PREOCCUPIED TRAVELLERS THE DIM DESOLATE WEATHER
SHE SAID HOW FRIGHTFULLY COLD IT IS
ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THROW ME OVER FOR A THING LIKE THIS
BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT OCCURRED TO HER WAS TO STOP AND LOOK IN ONE OF THE SHOPS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
AND YESTERDAY I HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DARLING
YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACTLY HOW A TRYST IS CONDUCTED IN THE PAGES OF THE STANDARD POETS AND OF THE CHEAPER WEEKLY JOURNALS
I DON'T WONDER YOU WERE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON'T LOVE ME YOU'VE NEVER LOVED ME I WAS AN IDIOT TO BELIEVE YOU DID
NO IT'S ONLY PAINFUL FOR BOTH OF US
I DIDN'T THINK A DECENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULLING ON HER GLOVES GO HOME AND GLOAT OVER IT ALL
THOSE FOUR TRUE WORDS WOUNDED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST
SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIMIT ALLOWED OF HER READING AND HER ENVIRONMENT THE LITERARY SENSE
A SHOCK OF UNBELIEVABLE RELIEF TINGLED THROUGH HER SO THAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMPARED WITH HER FEARS
ONE CAN ALMOST IMAGINE HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE FAMOUS RATHSKELLERS OF OLD HEIDELBERG NOT AT THE SCHLOSS OF COURSE FOR HERE YOU CANNOT LOOK DOWN ON THE WEISER AS IT FLOWS BENEATH THE WINDOWS OF THE GREAT WINE STUBE ON THE HILL
THOMPSON OPENED A LARGE RESTAURANT IN O'FARRELL STREET JUST ABOVE FILLMORE AND FOR TWO YEARS OR MORE DID A THRIVING BUSINESS HIS PLACE BEING NOTED FOR ITS GOOD COOKING AND ITS SPLENDID SERVICE
OF COURSE THESE ARE NOT THE ENTIRE MENUS BUT OF ALL THE WELL PREPARED DISHES THESE ARE THEIR BEST
THE FLY TRAP AND CHARLIE'S FASHION THE FIRST IN SUTTER STREET NEAR KEARNY AND THE OTHER IN MARKET NEAR SUTTER SERVE WELL COOKED FOODS ESPECIALLY SOUP SALADS AND FISH
SAN FRANCISCO'S CARE FREE SPIRIT WAS FULLY EXEMPLIFIED BEFORE THE ASHES OF THE GREAT FIRE OF NINETEEN O SIX WERE COLD
AT THE CORNER OF MARKET AND EDDY STREETS IS THE ODEON DOWN IN A BASEMENT WITH DECORATIONS OF MOST GARISH ORDER
THE POODLE DOG HAS A HOTEL ATTACHMENT WHERE ONE MAY GET ROOMS OR FULL APARTMENTS
THE RESTAURANTS OF THE PRESENT DAY THAT APPROACH NEAREST THE OLD BOHEMIAN RESTAURANTS OF PRE FIRE DAYS OF THE FRENCH CLASS ARE JACK'S IN SACRAMENTO STREET BETWEEN MONTGOMERY AND KEARNY FELIX IN MONTGOMERY STREET BETWEEN CLAY AND WASHINGTON AND THE POODLE DOG BERGEZ FRANKS IN BUSH STREET BETWEEN KEARNY AND GRANT AVENUE
THE HOF BRAU HOWEVER IS LESS DISTINCTIVELY GERMAN AS THE GREATER NUMBER OF ITS PATRONS ARE AMERICANS
PUT INTO THE OVEN AGAIN AND COOK FOR HALF AN HOUR BASTING FREQUENTLY WITH THE ORIGINAL BRINE
THEN TAKE IT OUT OF THE ROASTING PAN AND PUT IT INTO A CASSEROLE AFTER SPRINKLING IT WITH TWO OUNCES OF FLOUR
SEASON WITH SALT AND PEPPER AND A LITTLE SUGAR TO TASTE
AT THE TWO MENTIONED ONE PAYS FOR THE SURROUNDINGS AS WELL AS FOR THE FOOD AND SOMETIMES THIS IS WORTH PAYING FOR
JOHN TAIT IS THE PRESIDING SPIRIT HERE HE HAVING MADE REPUTATION AS CLUB MANAGER AND THEN AS MANAGER OF THE CLIFF HOUSE
STRAIN THE SAUCE THROUGH A FINE COLLANDER AND ADD A FEW RAISINS A PIECE OF HONEY CAKE OR GINGER SNAPS AND THE MEAT OF ONE FRESH TOMATO
IN THIS SAME DISTRICT IS THE MINT IN COMMERCIAL STREET BETWEEN MONTGOMERY AND KEARNY STREETS
THIS GARISH DISPLAY OF MIRRORS AND ELABORATE DECORATION OF CEILING AND PILLARS GIVES IT THE APPEARANCE OF THE ABODE OF SATURNALIA BUT DECORUM IS THE RULE AMONG THE PATRONS
PUT IN THE OVEN AND BROWN TO A GOLDEN COLOR
THEY ALSO HAVE AS THE CHEF IN CHARGE OF THE ABALONE DISHES HERBERT FORMERLY CHEF FOR ONE OF THE YACHT CLUBS OF THE COAST WHO CLAIMS TO HAVE THE ONLY PROPER RECIPE FOR MAKING ABALONE'S TENDER
THE CUISINE IS OF THE BEST AND THE CHEFS RANK AT THE TOP OF THEIR ART
IF YOU KNOW HOW TO ORDER AND DO NOT CARE TO COUNT THE COST WHEN YOU ORDER PROBABLY THE BEST DINNER AT THESE RESTAURANTS CAN BE HAD AT EITHER BLANCO'S OR THE POODLE DOG
THE SPECIALTY OF THE HOF BRAU IS ABALONE'S AND THEY HAVE AS A FEATURE THIS SHELL FISH COOKED IN SEVERAL WAYS
TO THE PICKLE ADD TWO LARGE ONIONS CUT IN QUARTERS TWO FRESH CARROTS AND ABOUT ONE OUNCE OF MIXED WHOLE ALLSPICE BLACK PEPPERS CLOVES AND BAY LEAVES
HERE THERE IS ALWAYS GOOD MUSIC AND FOOD WELL COOKED AND WELL SERVED AND ALWAYS A LIVELY CROWD DURING THE LUNCHEON DINNER AND AFTER THEATRE HOURS THE ROOM IS NOT LARGE BUT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE GREATLY MAGNIFIED OWING TO THE COVERING OF MIRRORS WHICH LINE THE WALLS
IN EITHER OF THESE RESTAURANTS YOU WILL BE SERVED WITH THE BEST THE MARKET AFFORDS COOKED THE RIGHT WAY
WHEN DONE TAKE THE MEAT OUT OF THE SAUCE
WE FINALLY GOT HIM TO SELECT THE ONE PRIZED ABOVE ALL OTHERS AND THIS IS WHAT CHEF SCHEILER GAVE US
IN ADDITION TO ABALONE'S THE HOF BRAU MAKES A SPECIALTY OF LITTLE OREGON CRAWFISH
HIS PRICES ARE MODERATE AND HIS COOKING AND VIANDS OF THE BEST AND WILL SATISFY THE MOST CRITICAL OF THE GOURMETS
IT IS AN IDEA THAT IS WORTH WHILE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPRIETORS DEPEND TOO MUCH ON THE DECORATIVE FEATURE AND TOO LITTLE ON THE FOOD AND HOW THEY SERVE IT
HERE AS WELL AS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES ONE CAN WELL APPRECIATE THE COLLOQUIAL DEFINITION OF CABARET
ONE OF HIS WAITERS PHIL TYSON WAS ONE OF THE EARLIER ONES TO GO BACK INTO THE BURNED DISTRICT TO BEGIN BUSINESS AND HE OPENED A RESTAURANT CALLED THE DEL MONTE IN POWELL STREET NEAR MARKET BUT IT WAS TOO EARLY FOR SUCCESS AND CLOSED AFTER A SHORT CAREER
IT HAS CHANGED FROM WHAT IT WAS IN THE OLD DAYS BUT IS STILL AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO DINE
BOTH SERVE GOOD SPANISH DINNERS AT REASONABLE PRICES
UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THE ABALONE IS TOUGH AND UNPALATABLE BUT AFTER THE DEFT MANIPULATION OF HERBERT THEY ARE TENDER AND MAKE A FINE DISH EITHER FRIED AS CHOWDER OR A LA NEWBERG
BUT IF YOU REALLY LOVE GOOD MUSIC MUSIC THAT HAS MELODY AND RHYTHM AND SOOTHING CADENCES GO TO THE HEIDELBERG INN AND LISTEN TO THE CONCERT WHICH IS A FEATURE OF THE PLACE EVERY EVENING

HOCHHEIMER A LIGHT PLEASING AND WHOLESOME WINE
VINTAGE YEARS HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH THE QUALITY OF WINES
NEVER DRINK ANY HARD LIQUORS SUCH AS WHISKY BRANDY GIN OR COCKTAILS WITH OYSTERS OR CLAMS AS IT IS LIABLE TO UPSET YOU FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING
WITH SOUP AND FISH SERVE WHITE WINES SUCH AS RHEIN WINE SAUTERNE OR WHITE BURGUNDY
I KNEW YOU WOULD GO I SAW YOU GETTING READY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO FOLLOW
THEN THE GOOD SOUL OPENLY SHOULDERED THE BURDEN SHE HAD BORNE SO LONG IN SECRET AND BRAVELY TRUDGED ON ALONE
NOW LET'S BE BRAVE AND ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT
THE BOYS BLESS THEIR BRAVE HEARTS HAVE DONE NOBLY BUT OLDER MEN ARE NEEDED NOW WE CANNOT SACRIFICE ALL THE GALLANT LADS AND WE WHO HAVE MORE TO LOSE THAN THEY MUST TAKE OUR TURN AND TRY TO DO AS WELL
BUT EVEN WHILE SHE ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF LIFE AND BEGRUDGED THE TIME GIVEN TO SLEEP SHE FELT AS IF THE DREAM WAS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST AND OFTEN SAID
I COULD NOT LOVE THEE DEAR SO MUCH LOVED I NOT HONOR MORE
HER MEETING WITH LETTY WAS INDESCRIBABLY TENDER AND THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED WERE PRETTY EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN HER AND HER BROTHER IN NURSING THE ONE AND LOVING THE OTHER
DAVID HELD IT CLOSE IN BOTH OF HIS SAYING GRATEFULLY THANK YOU MOTHER THEN FIXING HIS EYES ON THE YOUNGER YET NOT DEARER WOMEN HE ADDED WITH A RING IN HIS VOICE THAT MADE THEIR HEARTS ANSWER WITH A PROMPT AY AY IN SPITE OF LOVE OR FEAR
WE WILL WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU DAVY ASKED CHRISTIE WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED BY THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TOO
HIS WIFE FED HIM WITH THE FAT OF THE LAND REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCES HIS CHILDREN REVOLVED ABOUT HIM WITH TIRELESS CURIOSITY AND WONDER HIS NEIGHBORS FLOCKED IN TO APPLAUD ADVISE AND ADMIRE EVERY ONE TREATED HIM WITH A RESPECT MOST GRATEFUL TO HIS FEELINGS HE WAS AN OBJECT OF INTEREST AND WITH EVERY HOUR HIS IMPORTANCE INCREASED SO THAT BY NIGHT HE FELT LIKE A COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND BORE HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
HE'S A KIND NEIGHBORLY MAN AND HIS BOY WILL TAKE MY PLACE ABOUT THE HOUSE AND PROTECT YOU FAITHFULLY
SURELY I SHALL IF I GIVE YOU AND MYSELF TO THE CAUSE AND I DO IT GLADLY THOUGH I KNOW THAT MY HEART HAS GOT TO ACHE AS IT NEVER HAS ACHED YET WHEN MY COURAGE FAILS AS IT WILL BY AND BY AND MY SELFISH SOUL COUNTS THE COST OF MY OFFERING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT IS OVER
I SHALL WAIT FOR TIME TO SHOW
I HOPE YOU'LL LIKE HIM BETTER THAN THE FROST BITTEN OLD DAVID YOU FIRST KNEW AND WERE KIND ENOUGH TO LOVE
MISTER POWER IS WAITING ARE YOU READY LOVE QUITE READY
FINDING THAT LISHA SHOWED LITTLE ENTHUSIASM ON THE SUBJECT SHE TRIED TO ROUSE HIM BY PATRIOTIC APPEALS OF VARIOUS SORTS
TO SAY THAT THE FISH ROSE AT ONCE AND SWALLOWED THE BAIT HOOK AND ALL BUT FEEBLY EXPRESSES THE JUSTICE DONE TO THE CAKES BY THAT LONG SUFFERING MAN
HE WAS NOT AS UNMOVED AS HE SEEMED BY THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT AND HAD FELT SUNDRY MANLY IMPULSES TO UP AND AT EM WHEN HIS COMRADES IN THE SHOP DISCUSSED THE CRISIS WITH IREFUL BRANDISHING OF AWLS AND VENGEFUL POUNDING OF SOLE LEATHER AS IF THE REBELS WERE UNDER THE HAMMER
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY KNAPSACKS TO HOLD ALL THE GIFTS SHOWERED UPON HIM BY HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS
YOU YOUNG FOLKS TAKE A WEDDING TRIP TO THE GREEN HOUSE WHILE WE SEE HOW WELL WE CAN GET ON WITHOUT YOU
I DON'T WANT YOU TO I LOVE TO SEE YOU SO YOUNG AND HAPPY ONLY YOU ARE NOT THE OLD DAVID AND I'VE GOT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEW ONE
EXCELLENTLY I LIKE PRIDE OF YOUR SORT IMPETUOSITY BECOMES YOU FOR YOU HAVE LEARNED TO CONTROL IT IF NEED BE AND THE AMBITION IS BEST OF ALL
DAVID CAUGHT THE EXALTATION AND GAVE NO FURTHER THOUGHT TO ANY THING BUT THE DUTY OF THE HOUR FINDING HIMSELF STRONGER AND BRAVER FOR THAT LONG LOOK INTO THE ILLUMINATED FACE OF THE WOMAN HE LOVED
WE CAN'T AFFORD NO NICE VITTLES NOW WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERIN SO
DAVID AND CHRISTIE WENT SMILING AWAY TOGETHER AND IF THEY SHED ANY TEARS OVER THE BRIEF HAPPINESS NO ONE SAW THEM BUT THE FLOWERS AND THEY LOYALLY KEPT THE SECRET FOLDED UP IN THEIR TENDER HEARTS
I'M NOT A TALKER YOU KNOW AND AS THE LAWS OF GRAVITATION FORBID MY SOARING ALOFT ANYWHERE I CAN ONLY EXPRESS MY JOYFULLY UPLIFTED STATE OF MIND BY PRANCING AS YOU CALL IT
TO NO HOME IN THE LAND DID THE GREAT TROUBLE BRING A MORE SUDDEN CHANGE THAN THE LITTLE COTTAGE IN THE LANE
NOT ONE DAVID THAT'S TRUE LOVE CHRISTIE
NO HE AIN'T IT'S A TRAINER ADDED ANN LIZY
THE LOYAL FRENZY FELL UPON THE THREE QUIET WOMEN AND THEY COULD NOT DO TOO MUCH FOR THEIR COUNTRY
IN THAT CASE YOU WILL FIND ME A PROUD IMPETUOUS AMBITIOUS FELLOW CHRISTIE AND HOW WILL THAT SUIT
THE ROSES ARE FOR THEY REMIND ME OF POOR HELEN AND THE FIRST WORK I DID WITH DAVID WAS ARRANGING FLOWERS LIKE THESE FOR A DEAD BABY'S LITTLE COFFIN
BUT I THINK FEW BRIDES DRESS WITH A BRAVER HAPPIER HEART THAN MINE THOUGH I DO CHOOSE A SOBER WEDDING GOWN ANSWERED CHRISTIE SMILING AGAIN AS SHE TOOK FROM A HALF PACKED TRUNK HER NEW HOSPITAL SUIT OF SOFT GRAY WOOLLEN STUFF
MOTHER SAYS I'VE GONE BACK TO THE TIME BEFORE WE LOST LETTY AND I SOMETIMES FEEL AS IF I HAD
NEXT EVENING AS MISSUS STERLING SAT ALONE IN THE TWILIGHT A TALL MAN IN ARMY BLUE ENTERED QUIETLY STOOD WATCHING THE TRANQUIL FIGURE FOR A MOMENT THEN WENT AND KNELT DOWN BESIDE IT SAYING WITH A MOST UNSOLDIERLY CHOKE IN THE VOICE
CAN YOU REMEMBER WHAT HEPSEY TOLD US AND CALL THEM POOR LONG SUFFERIN CREETERS NAMES
THEN THEY STOOD QUITE STILL FOR A TIME AND IN THE SILENCE THE TWO HEARTS TALKED TOGETHER IN THE SWEET LANGUAGE NO TONGUE CAN UTTER
THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR WORK LITTLE DREAMING AS THEY TIED ROSES AND TWINED SMILAX WREATHS HOW NEAR THAT OTHER CHANCE WAS HOW SOON THEY WERE TO BE CALLED UPON TO KEEP THEIR PROMISE AND HOW WELL EACH WAS TO PERFORM THE PART GIVEN THEM IN LIFE AND DEATH
I FEEL LIKE A BOY OUT OF SCHOOL OR RATHER A MAN OUT OF PRISON AND MUST ENJOY MY LIBERTY IN SOME WAY
A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE MARRIAGE FEAST BUT MORE LOVE GOOD WILL AND TENDER WISHES ADORNED THE PLAIN TABLE THAN IS OFTEN FOUND AT WEDDING BREAKFASTS AND BETTER THAN ANY SPEECH OR SONG WAS LETTY'S BROKEN WHISPER AS SHE FOLDED HER ARMS ROUND DAVID'S EMPTY CHAIR WHEN NO ONE SAW HER HEAVEN BLESS AND KEEP AND BRING HIM BACK TO US
VERY WELL SAID MISSUS WILKINS RESOLUTELY TO HERSELF EF I CAN'T MAKE NO IMPRESSION ON HIS SOUL I WILL ON HIS STOMMICK AND SEE HOW THAT'LL WORK
AND THE INCONSISTENT WOMAN FELL UPON HIS BUTTONY BREAST WEEPING COPIOUSLY
YOU'VE SOMETHING TO TELL ME I SEE IT IN YOUR FACE DEAR I MUST GO
BENNET WILL TAKE THE GARDEN AND GREEN HOUSE OFF MY HANDS THIS AUTUMN FOR A YEAR OR LONGER IF I LIKE
THEY KNEW WHAT IT WAS WITHOUT A WORD MISSUS STERLING CLASPED HER HANDS AND BOWED HER HEAD
ALL WATCHED WITH QUICKENED BREATH AND PROUD SOULS THAT LIVING WAVE BLUE BELOW AND BRIGHT WITH A STEELY GLITTER ABOVE AS IT FLOWED DOWN THE STREET AND AWAY TO JOIN THE SEA OF DAUNTLESS HEARTS THAT FOR MONTHS HAD ROLLED UP AGAINST THE SOUTH AND EBBED BACK REDDENED WITH THE BLOOD OF MEN LIKE THESE
NOTHING CAN SURPRISE ME NOW I'M PREPARED FOR ANY THING EVEN THE SIGHT OF MY QUAKERISH LOVER DANCING A JIG
IT IS TERRIBLE AND YET GLORIOUS
AS A MARRIED WOMAN YOU WILL GET ON BETTER AS MY WIFE YOU WILL BE ALLOWED TO COME TO ME IF I NEED YOU AND AS MY HE STOPPED THERE FOR HE COULD NOT ADD AS MY WIDOW YOU WILL HAVE MY PENSION TO SUPPORT YOU
NOTHING CAN PART US ANY MORE NOT EVEN DEATH FOR LOVE LIKE OURS WILL LAST FOR EVER
DAVID WAS SOBER ENOUGH NOW AND WENT ABOUT HIS WORK WITH A GRIM SET TO HIS LIPS AND A SPARK IN HIS EYES THAT MADE THE THREE WOMEN LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER PALE WITH UNSPOKEN APPREHENSION
SO CHRISTIE TURNED A DEAF EAR TO HER PROPHETIC SOUL AND GAVE HERSELF UP TO THE BLISSFUL HOLIDAY THAT HAD COME AT LAST
THEN SHE SAW DAVID AND THE REGIMENT BECAME ONE MAN TO HER
THE WOMEN DROPPED THEIR WORK TO LOOK AND LISTEN FOR HIS VISITS WERE FEW AND SHORT AND EVERY INSTANT WAS PRECIOUS
YES DAVID SISTER AND SWEETHEART ANSWERED BRAVELY FORGETTING IN THE FERVOR OF THE MOMENT WHAT HEAVY CONSEQUENCES GOD MIGHT SEE FIT TO SEND GOOD
YOU WILL LET ME DO IT AND IN RETURN I WILL MARRY YOU WHENEVER YOU ASK ME ANSWERED CHRISTIE SEALING THE PROMISE WITH A KISS THAT SILENCED HIM
NOW CYNTHY BE YOU SATISFIED
IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINKIES WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE
EVEN IN AMERICA EVER'BODY BOWS LOW TO OUR PRESIDENT AN THE BLUESKINS ARE SO FRAID O THEIR BOOLOOROO THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR HIM
WHAT THAT LITTLE CABIN
ARE YOU A GIANT
PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDICULE ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE SAILOR'S FACE CLOSELY
EXCLAIMED TROT OF COURSE
BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TOURMALINE GRAVELY
NO OUR WAY IS BEST
IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FREE
DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALACE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED
THE QUEEN GAZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTEREST
WE DO NOT HATE YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLUESKINS DO NOR ARE WE SAVAGE OR CRUEL BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU HERE AND I AM REALLY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU
THE QUEEN HAS NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ADJUST GRIEVANCES AND TO COMPEL ORDER
SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARNING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS
SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY
I HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVILEGE
I'LL LOOK IN THE GREAT BOOK FIRST
SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE BUTTON BRIGHT'S OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAP'N BILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE
THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN THE CROWD
YES IT WAS WET AN STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILOR BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AN WE GOT THROUGH ALL RIGHT
HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROT'S SKIN
THEY SEEM VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY
AFTER MY DEATH A PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKIES IN AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD
YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY
IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS WHO HAVE EVER STEPPED A FOOT IN OUR LAND
A MISFORTUNE OF BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FATE
THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACE
WHAT IS IT CORALIE SHE ASKED THE WOMAN
THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS
THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL
IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE
HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALACE OF TOURMALINE WHO IS OUR QUEEN
CORALIE DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING A QUEEN
IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE
SINCE THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DIMINISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES AND SEVERAL WITH A BETTER TEMPER THAN IN SEVENTEEN O SEVEN HAVE NOW TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERNMENT
HE CERTAINLY POSSESSES TALENTS BEYOND THE RUDE SPHERE IN WHICH HE MOVES AND BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR ENCUMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WAVERLEY ANY SUCH HAIR BRAINED EXPEDITION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE HAD INEXPRESSIBLE CHARMS FOR ME
THEY HELD CONVENTICLES IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK ARMS DURING THOSE REIGNS
MISTER MORTON SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAVERLEY'S VISIT TO DONALD BEAN LEAN
EVIL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER MORTON OR WHO HOLDS CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND CEREMONIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE GAGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH OR MORAL VIRTUE
MISTER MORTON REPLIED THAT FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAIM UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESERVING IT
CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A CONFIDANT
HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NOR WITH MY WRETCHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPICIONS AND HIS INFERENCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE RACKS OF THE INQUISITION
MISTER MORTON THEN MADE A CAREFUL MEMORANDUM OF THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAVERLEY'S INTERVIEW WITH DONALD BEAN LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED
TWO BATTLEMENTED WALLS ONE OF WHICH FACED THE AVENUE AND THE OTHER DIVIDED THE COURT FROM THE GARDEN COMPLETED THE INCLOSURE
THE HOUSE WHICH SEEMED TO CONSIST OF TWO OR THREE HIGH NARROW AND STEEP ROOFED BUILDINGS PROJECTING FROM EACH OTHER AT RIGHT ANGLES FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE INCLOSURE
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE EFFECTS WHICH A PAINTER LOVES TO REPRESENT AND MINGLED WELL WITH THE STRUGGLING LIGHT WHICH FOUND ITS WAY BETWEEN THE BOUGHS OF THE SHADY ARCH THAT VAULTED THE BROAD GREEN ALLEY
STABLES AND OTHER OFFICES OCCUPIED ANOTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE
THE HOUSES SEEMED MISERABLE IN THE EXTREME ESPECIALLY TO AN EYE ACCUSTOMED TO THE SMILING NEATNESS OF ENGLISH COTTAGES
IT WAS ABOUT NOON WHEN CAPTAIN WAVERLEY ENTERED THE STRAGGLING VILLAGE OR RATHER HAMLET OF TULLY VEOLAN CLOSE TO WHICH WAS SITUATED THE MANSION OF THE PROPRIETOR
THE EVIL AND REMEDY SUCH AS IT IS STILL EXIST BUT THIS IS REMOTE FROM OUR PRESENT PURPOSE AND IS ONLY THROWN OUT FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE COLLECTORS UNDER MISTER DENT'S DOG BILL
EVERYTHING AROUND APPEARED SOLITARY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENT BUT FOR THE CONTINUED PLASHING OF THE FOUNTAIN AND THE WHOLE SCENE STILL MAINTAINED THE MONASTIC ILLUSION WHICH THE FANCY OF WAVERLEY HAD CONJURED UP
OCCASIONALLY INDEED WHEN SUCH A CONSUMMATION SEEMED INEVITABLE A WATCHFUL OLD GRANDAM WITH HER CLOSE CAP DISTAFF AND SPINDLE RUSHED LIKE A SIBYL IN FRENZY OUT OF ONE OF THESE MISERABLE CELLS DASHED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH AND SNATCHING UP HER OWN CHARGE FROM AMONG THE SUNBURNT LOITERERS SALUTED HIM WITH A SOUND CUFF AND TRANSPORTED HIM BACK TO HIS DUNGEON THE LITTLE WHITE HEADED VARLET SCREAMING ALL THE WHILE FROM THE VERY TOP OF HIS LUNGS A SHRILLY TREBLE TO THE GROWLING REMONSTRANCES OF THE ENRAGED MATRON
THIS AVENUE WAS STRAIGHT AND OF MODERATE LENGTH RUNNING BETWEEN A DOUBLE ROW OF VERY ANCIENT HORSE CHESTNUTS PLANTED ALTERNATELY WITH SYCAMORES WHICH ROSE TO SUCH HUGE HEIGHT AND NOURISHED SO LUXURIANTLY THAT THEIR BOUGHS COMPLETELY OVER ARCHED THE BROAD ROAD BENEATH
THE COURT WAS SPACIOUS WELL PAVED AND PERFECTLY CLEAN THERE BEING PROBABLY ANOTHER ENTRANCE BEHIND THE STABLES FOR REMOVING THE LITTER
NEITHER DID THE FRONT INDICATE ABSOLUTE SECURITY FROM DANGER
IT HAD BEEN BUILT AT A PERIOD WHEN CASTLES WERE NO LONGER NECESSARY AND WHEN THE SCOTTISH ARCHITECTS HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED THE ART OF DESIGNING A DOMESTIC RESIDENCE
THIS WORK OF ART WAS THE WONDER OF THE COUNTRY TEN MILES ROUND
YET THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF THE PEOPLE WHEN MORE CLOSELY EXAMINED WAS FAR FROM EXHIBITING THE INDIFFERENCE OF STUPIDITY THEIR FEATURES WERE ROUGH BUT REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT GRAVE BUT THE VERY REVERSE OF STUPID AND FROM AMONG THE YOUNG WOMEN AN ARTIST MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN MORE THAN ONE MODEL WHOSE FEATURES AND FORM RESEMBLED THOSE OF MINERVA
AFTER JUPITER HAD BOUND PROMETHEUS ON MOUNT CAUCASUS AND HAD SENT DISEASES AND CARES INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY WICKED
IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAMED DEUCALION AND HE WAS THE SON OF PROMETHEUS
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
SURELY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DEUCALION
WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED PYRRHA
BUT DEUCALION AND PYRRHA WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSONS WHO WERE LEFT ALIVE IN ALL THE LAND
GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MERCURY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULDERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEAPED INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
THE DAY IS COMING SAID PROMETHEUS WHEN JUPITER WILL SEND A FLOOD TO DESTROY MANKIND FROM THE EARTH
NO ONE BUT DEUCALION THE SON OF PROMETHEUS WAS READY FOR SUCH A STORM
WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NOBLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEINGS ALL EAGER TO SERVE THEM
WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DEUCALION TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LONELY PLACE INDEED
BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHTING AND ROBBING EVEN WHILE THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHTY COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOURCE OF TROUBLE
THE LADY IN WAITING BECAME VERY IMPATIENT AND AT LENGTH ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAITED FOR HER
ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIRIES OVERHEARING HER AND FANCYING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MISCHIEF TO THE LITTLE BABY WENT AND HID HERSELF BEHIND THE HANGINGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UNDO ANY HARM THE OLD FAIRY MIGHT WISH TO WORK
HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CASTLE BUT BEHOLD
WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRISTENING FEAST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN
MEANWHILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CASTLE HAD BEEN WAKENED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXTREMELY HUNGRY
BUT THE FACES OF THE MEN WERE ROSY AND THE GOBLETS BY THEM HAD A FEW DROPS OF WINE LEFT
ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENCHANTED CASTLE ANOTHER THAT WITCHES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVED THAT IT WAS OCCUPIED BY A GREAT OGRE WHICH CARRIED THITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CATCH AND ATE THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NOBODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AWAKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
HE ENTERED A LARGE FORECOURT AND STOOD STILL WITH AMAZEMENT AND AWE
SCARCELY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND THORNS WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMPENETRABLE THICKET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFFER HIM A PATH
SHE HAD NO SOONER TAKEN UP THE SPINDLE THAN BEING HASTY AND CARELESS SHE PIERCED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FAINTED AWAY
HE PASSED THROUGH ONE APARTMENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ASLEEP IN THEIR CHAIRS OR STANDING
HE ENTERED THE GUARD ROOM THERE THE GUARDS STOOD DRAWN UP IN LINE WITH CARBINES AT THEIR SHOULDERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND ASLEEP
NOW FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CASTLES AND AS SHE WAS RUNNING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CHAMBER AT THE TOP OF A TOWER AND THERE SAT AN HONEST OLD WOMAN SPINNING FOR SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING'S EDICT
THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FELT HIMSELF ON FIRE
IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRELY UNDO WHAT MY ELDER HAS DONE
THEY TALKED FOR FOUR HOURS AND HAD NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEADS TO SAY
THE VIOLINS AND HAUT BOYS PLAYED OLD BUT EXCELLENT PIECES OF MUSIC AND AFTER SUPPER TO LOSE NO TIME THE GRAND ALMONER MARRIED THE ROYAL LOVERS IN THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE
THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESSED IN GREAT SPLENDOUR BUT HE DID NOT HINT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICTURES OF HIS GREAT GRANDMOTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHARMING FOR THAT
I HAVE WAITED LONG FOR YOU
THE TURN OF THE OLD FAIRY HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECLARED WHILE HER HEAD SHOOK WITH MALICE THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIERCE HER HAND WITH A SPINDLE AND DIE OF THE WOUND
THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLIC ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILY INTO WHOSE REFINED EAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEM BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK
ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACH
MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVOLVULUS POLE TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELLED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND
HE REALLY GRIEVED TO SEE IT
I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TIE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH
WHAT A FUSS IS MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
WEEDS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION REIGNED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND BRILLIANT LITTLE GARDEN
YOU SURELY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BARE STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON NOW
THE MISTRESS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVOURITE GARDEN
THE HONEYSUCKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATION WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELLED HER TO THE DIRT
YOUR COUSIN THE WILD CONVOLVULUS WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
MY YOUNG PLANTS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE POTS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIRE WORMS WHO DELIGHT TO DESTROY OUR ROOTS
BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARM WORK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES
IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
MEANWHILE HOW FARED IT WITH THE FLOWERS
WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO LUXURIATE IN A NATURAL MANNER
DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSE THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
INDEED NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUGGESTIONS
STILL THE ROSE TREE STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS IN THE WOODS
OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY FIR POLE
AS FOR THE EUCHARIST TRANSUBSTANTIATION THE REAL PRESENCE IT WAS ALL NO MYSTERY TO THEM BUT PALPABLE EVIDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT JESUITS
MY READERS MAY IMAGINE WHETHER WE FELT INCLINED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHARMING CREATURE BADE US GOOD NIGHT THANKING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH
BESIDES I WAS OF OPINION THAT A MAN'S PROFESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPPLY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISFY ALL HIS WANTS AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFICER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER MY EXPENSES BECAUSE MY EDUCATION HAD GIVEN ME GREATER WANTS THAN THOSE OF OFFICERS IN GENERAL
THEY BELIEVED THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSSESSED THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE THE UNIVERSAL PANACEA THE INTERCOURSE WITH ALL THE ELEMENTARY HEAVENLY AND INFERNAL SPIRITS THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THANKS TO MY SUBLIME SCIENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRETS OF EVERY GOVERNMENT IN EUROPE
I PICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEPS I HANDED IT TO HIM
TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDERED A SERVANT TO HURRY OUT FOR A PHYSICIAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDERED THE PATIENT TO BE BLED AGAIN THUS APPROVING THE FIRST BLEEDING PRESCRIBED BY ME
HE WROTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEANING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
I DECLARED MYSELF QUITE WILLING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRAZEN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VENTURED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
I JUMPED OUT OF THE GONDOLA AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SPOT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD TAUGHT RAZETTA SUCH A FORCIBLE LESSON I ENQUIRED FOR A SURGEON AT THE FIRST COFFEE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME
THERE WAS NO COWARDLY TRAITOR AMONGST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NOCTURNAL PRANKS WERE NOT RENEWED
NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TEACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HERMIT ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMMUNICATED MY SCIENCE TO ANYONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PREDICTION
I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROFESSION AS I WAS NOT BLESSED WITH THE VOCATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED ONLY BY DINT OF HYPOCRISY AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESPICABLE IN MY OWN ESTIMATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURPLE MANTLE ON MY SHOULDERS FOR THE GREATEST DIGNITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN'S OWN CONSCIENCE
NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MORROW
I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISHED TO FOLLOW THE RULES OF PURE MORALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECLINED INTIMATE INTERCOURSE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UNDECEIVED THEM
I THREW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASSURE HIM OF MY GRATITUDE AND EMBRACED HIM CALLING HIM MY FATHER
IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENTY TWO PARISHES OF THE CITY OF VENICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAGAZZINO
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WHILST I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRESERVE A MODEST SILENCE
THE THREE FRIENDS WERE ASTOUNDED
BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPECULATIVE CHATTERING OF EMPTY FOOLS WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MORAL PHENOMENON THEY MEET WITH WHICH THEIR NARROW INTELLECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND
WHERE IS MY HUSBAND
WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT RAMBLING ABOUT THE CITY INVENTING AND CARRYING INTO EXECUTION THE MOST IMPERTINENT PRACTICAL JOKES
HE ENTREATED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH
DELIGHTED WITH SUCH A FORTUNATE RESULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN
OUR SCANDALOUS PROCEEDINGS OFTEN EXPOSED US TO THE GREATEST DANGER
WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISONERS TO A LARGE BOAT
WHOEVER YOU MAY BE I AM INDEBTED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE
I OBEYED IMPLICITLY AND MET YOUR EXCELLENCY
THINKING I HAD A RIGHT TO WATCH THE SICK MAN I SETTLED MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQUIRED
THIS IS THE AMUSING ADVENTURE WHICH CLOSED OUR EXPLOITS
UNWILLING TO HURT HIS VANITY BY TELLING HIM THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOLUTION OF INFORMING HIM IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSSESSED A CERTAIN NUMERAL CALCULUS WHICH GAVE ANSWERS ALSO IN NUMBERS TO ANY QUESTIONS I LIKED TO PUT
THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM WAS NAMED TERRO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PECULIAR TRAIN OF REASONING THAT HE COULD CURE HIM BY APPLYING A MERCURIAL OINTMENT TO THE CHEST TO WHICH NO ONE RAISED ANY OBJECTION
WHENEVER WE COULD CONTRIVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TOWER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT FUN TO FRIGHTEN ALL THE PARISH BY RINGING THE ALARM BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BROKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL ROPES SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCHWARDENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUMMONING THE FAITHFUL TO EARLY MASS
THE WAITER OF THE MAGAZZINO CAME TO BE PAID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DUE ENJOINING SILENCE UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH
YOUR APARTMENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTHES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERVANT A GONDOLA AT YOUR ORDERS MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SEQUINS A MONTH
YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE FUTURE THINK ONLY OF ENJOYING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADVISER IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPPEN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERTAKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FINDING ME YOUR FRIEND
YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIVATE ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN A TABLE SURROUNDED WITH BENCHES IN WHICH A RESPECTABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJOY THEMSELVES IN A DECENT WAY
WE DID THE SAME WITH PHYSICIANS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESSED TO SOME NOBLEMAN WHO WAS ENJOYING EXCELLENT HEALTH
HE HAD GAMBLED AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BITTER ENEMY BECAUSE HE WAS INFATUATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO POISON HIM
WHAT EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WILL SOMETIMES OCCUR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
I WAS COMPELLED BY POVERTY TO BECOME A MEMBER OF A MUSICAL BAND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER ESTEEM NOR CONSIDERATION AND I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIVINITY AS AN ECCLESIASTIC AND AS AN OFFICER IN THE ARMY AND HAD WELCOMED ME IN THE HIGHEST SOCIETY
IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REPAIRED TO THE TWO SWORDS WHERE THEY HAD SPENT AN HOUR IN DRINKING
BUT ALTHOUGH BELIEVING FULLY IN MY ORACLES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEARTED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEVIL AND IT SUITED THEIR NATURAL GOODNESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWERS INSPIRED BY SOME HEAVENLY SPIRIT
THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQUIRE TO TEACH THEM THE RULES OF MY SUBLIME CALCULUS
I RUBBED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF INDISTINCT WHISPER THAT THE NUMBNESS WAS SPREADING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS DYING
I TOLD HIM AND HE INSISTED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GONDOLA SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBSCURE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRISTIANS AND FAITHFUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN REAL DEVOTEES AND FULL OF SCRUPLES
TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS OUR NOCTURNAL ORGY BEGAN TO BE TALKED OF
WITH AN EDUCATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE ENSURED ME AN HONOURABLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELLIGENCE WIT GOOD LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND ENDOWED WITH THOSE ACCIDENTAL PHYSICAL QUALITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASSPORT INTO SOCIETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOWER OF A SUBLIME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT TALENT IS RIGHTLY ADMIRED MEDIOCRITY IS AS RIGHTLY DESPISED
JUST THRUST AND PARRY AND VICTORY TO THE STRONGER
TEN SECONDS
A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I EXIST
SWEAT COVERED BRION'S BODY TRICKLING INTO THE TIGHT LOINCLOTH THAT WAS THE ONLY GARMENT HE WORE
HE ASKED THE HANDLER WHO WAS KNEADING HIS ACHING MUSCLES
EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE TWENTIES HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRICKS
PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICLES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS
THE BUZZER'S WHIRR TRIGGERED HIS MUSCLES INTO COMPLETE RELAXATION
BREATHING DEEPLY BRION SOFTLY SPOKE THE AUTO HYPNOTIC PHRASES THAT TRIGGERED THE PROCESS
BRION SAW SOMETHING CLOSE TO PANIC ON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE WHEN THE MAN FINALLY RECOGNIZED HIS ERROR
A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM IROLG BRION SENSED IT AND KNEW THE FIFTH POINT WAS HIS
WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FOIL FROM HIS SECOND'S STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD
ONLY HIS HEART AND LUNGS WORKED ON AT A STRONG MEASURED RATE
THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A HARSH URGENCY CLEARLY USED TO COMMAND
ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND THE TIME BUZZER SOUNDED
I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRANDD IS THE ONE I MUST SEE NOW STAND ASIDE
IROLG LOOKED AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED
HE WAS IN REVERIE SLIDING ALONG THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
THEN THE POWERFUL TWIST THAT THRUST IT ASIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD
THIS IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONSCIOUS
OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING THE TWENTIES AND DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT
THE CONTESTANTS IN THE TWENTIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS IN THE DORMITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH
HE THOUGHT IT WAS A LAST BURST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSE THEY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION
THE TWENTIES
A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY NEEDED EVERY FRACTION OF IT
A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WITH AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF ENERGY
THERE APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEATH TRAUMA AS IF THE TWO WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED INTO ONE
THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVERSTRAINED EYES EVEN THE SOARING ARENA AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT
HE MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRUDER SAID QUICKLY PUT THAT AWAY YOU'RE BEING A FOOL OUT
THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING BRION WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP
HIS INSTANT OF PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST
THE STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOMEONE IN A TRANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS
THERE COULD BE LITTLE ART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OF FENCING
MISTER QUILTER IS THE APOSTLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES AND WE ARE GLAD TO WELCOME HIS GOSPEL
NOR IS MISTER QUILTER'S MANNER LESS INTERESTING THAN HIS MATTER
ON THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ART MISTER QUILTER WRITES WITH EQUAL LUCIDITY
NEAR THE FIRE AND THE ORNAMENTS FRED BROUGHT HOME FROM INDIA ON THE MANTEL BOARD
IN FACT HE IS QUITE SEVERE ON MISTER RUSKIN FOR NOT RECOGNISING THAT A PICTURE SHOULD DENOTE THE FRAILTY OF MAN AND REMARKS WITH PLEASING COURTESY AND FELICITOUS GRACE THAT MANY PHASES OF FEELING
PAINTING HE TELLS US IS OF A DIFFERENT QUALITY TO MATHEMATICS AND FINISH IN ART IS ADDING MORE FACT
AS FOR ETCHINGS THEY ARE OF TWO KINDS BRITISH AND FOREIGN
ONLY UNFORTUNATELY HIS OWN WORK NEVER DOES GET GOOD
LINNELL'S PICTURES ARE A SORT OF UP GUARDS AND AT EM PAINTINGS AND MASON'S EXQUISITE IDYLLS ARE AS NATIONAL AS A JINGO POEM MISTER BIRKET FOSTER'S LANDSCAPES SMILE AT ONE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT MISTER CARKER USED TO FLASH HIS TEETH AND MISTER JOHN COLLIER GIVES HIS SITTER A CHEERFUL SLAP ON THE BACK BEFORE HE SAYS LIKE A SHAMPOOER IN A TURKISH BATH NEXT MAN
IT IS OBVIOUSLY UNNECESSARY FOR US TO POINT OUT HOW LUMINOUS THESE CRITICISMS ARE HOW DELICATE IN EXPRESSION
MISTER QUILTER HAS MISSED HIS CHANCE FOR HE HAS FAILED EVEN TO MAKE HIMSELF THE TUPPER OF PAINTING
HE LAMENTS MOST BITTERLY THE DIVORCE THAT HAS BEEN MADE BETWEEN DECORATIVE ART AND WHAT WE USUALLY CALL PICTURES MAKES THE CUSTOMARY APPEAL TO THE LAST JUDGMENT AND REMINDS US THAT IN THE GREAT DAYS OF ART MICHAEL ANGELO WAS THE FURNISHING UPHOLSTERER
BY HARRY QUILTER M A
HE TELLS US THAT AT THIS FESTIVE SEASON OF THE YEAR WITH CHRISTMAS AND ROAST BEEF LOOMING BEFORE US SIMILES DRAWN FROM EATING AND ITS RESULTS OCCUR MOST READILY TO THE MIND
HE HAS GRAVE DOUBTS WHETHER SIR FREDERICK LEIGHTON'S WORK IS REALLY GREEK AFTER ALL AND CAN DISCOVER IN IT BUT LITTLE OF ROCKY ITHACA
I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHAGGY
HE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED POLYCHROME WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEEZE INTO THE ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCES WITH MUCH INTEREST
HOWEVER IF WE LOOK SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF THESE SECRET WAYS
KALIKO HESITATED
BECAUSE YOU WERE SLEEPING INSTEAD OF CONQUERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAS BECOME A FIDDLE WITHOUT A BOW WHILE POOR SHAGGY SITS THERE A COOING DOVE
I DON'T BELIEVE ANN KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SHE'D HAVE WORKED IT BEFORE
HE EATS AND SLEEPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW KING
NOT EXACTLY RETURNED KALIKO
IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS OUR NOMES WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WORRIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY
I ALSO OFFERED TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE BUT HE WOULD NOT GO
INQUIRED SHAGGY IN THE METAL FOREST
I BEGGED RUGGEDO LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO
HE DOESN'T WORK AT ALL
I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID SHAGGY
HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN KALIKO FIRST POUNDED THE GONG AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RUGGEDO'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGGEDO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD
THE KING HAS FLED IN DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU
WHERE IS MY BROTHER NOW
KALIKO WENT TO THE BIG GONG AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS RUGGEDO USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS
THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED BETSY THOUGHTFULLY
THE METAL FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DOMED CAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED KALIKO
THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE RAPS AND OPENED THE DOOR
I HAVE REMAINED A PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO BE ONE AND WITH THIS HE STEPPED FORWARD AND BURST THE STOUT CHAINS AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THREADS
WHERE IS THAT
OH NO I'M QUITE SURE HE DIDN'T
TRUE AGREED KALIKO
D'AVRIGNY SAID VILLEFORT BE SO KIND I BESEECH YOU AS TO ACCOMPANY THIS GENTLEMAN HERE IS THE KEY OF THE DOOR SO THAT YOU CAN GO IN AND OUT AS YOU PLEASE YOU WILL BRING THE PRIEST WITH YOU AND WILL OBLIGE ME BY INTRODUCING HIM INTO MY CHILD'S ROOM DO YOU WISH TO SEE HIM
FOR SOME TIME NOTHING WAS HEARD IN THAT CHAMBER BUT SOBS EXCLAMATIONS AND PRAYERS
NOIRTIER LOOKED UPON MORREL WITH ONE OF THOSE MELANCHOLY SMILES WHICH HAD SO OFTEN MADE VALENTINE HAPPY AND THUS FIXED HIS ATTENTION
SAID MORREL SADLY YES REPLIED NOIRTIER
WHAT DO YOU MEAN SIR
I ONLY WISH TO BE ALONE YOU WILL EXCUSE ME WILL YOU NOT
GO DO YOU HEAR
GENTLEMEN HE SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE GIVE ME YOUR WORD OF HONOR THAT THIS HORRIBLE SECRET SHALL FOREVER REMAIN BURIED AMONGST OURSELVES THE TWO MEN DREW BACK
IT WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE TO WITNESS THE SILENT AGONY THE MUTE DESPAIR OF NOIRTIER WHOSE TEARS SILENTLY ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS
BUT HE STOPPED ON THE LANDING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AGAIN VISIT THE DEATH CHAMBER
MY FATHER HAS REVEALED THE CULPRIT'S NAME MY FATHER THIRSTS FOR REVENGE AS MUCH AS YOU DO YET EVEN HE CONJURES YOU AS I DO TO KEEP THIS SECRET DO YOU NOT FATHER
BUT IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE STAIRCASE GROANED BENEATH AN EXTRAORDINARY WEIGHT
MUST I LEAVE ALONE NO
AT THIS MOMENT THE WHOLE SOUL OF THE OLD MAN SEEMED CENTRED IN HIS EYES WHICH BECAME BLOODSHOT THE VEINS OF THE THROAT SWELLED HIS CHEEKS AND TEMPLES BECAME PURPLE AS THOUGH HE WAS STRUCK WITH EPILEPSY NOTHING WAS WANTING TO COMPLETE THIS BUT THE UTTERANCE OF A CRY
THE TWO DOCTORS THEREFORE ENTERED THE ROOM ALONE
MORREL SUFFERED AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR AND SURPRISE TO ESCAPE HIM
THE OLD MAN MADE A SIGN IN THE AFFIRMATIVE
NOIRTIER WAS NEAR THE BED PALE MOTIONLESS AND SILENT AS THE CORPSE
AND THE CRY ISSUED FROM HIS PORES IF WE MAY THUS SPEAK A CRY FRIGHTFUL IN ITS SILENCE
BUT CAN HE UNDERSTAND YOU YES
THE DISTRICT DOCTOR APPROACHED WITH THE INDIFFERENCE OF A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND HALF HIS TIME AMONGST THE DEAD HE THEN LIFTED THE SHEET WHICH WAS PLACED OVER THE FACE AND JUST UNCLOSED THE LIPS
OH YOU RAVE SIR EXCLAIMED VILLEFORT IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO ESCAPE THE NET IN WHICH HE WAS TAKEN I RAVE
I AM GOING SIR AND I DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAT NO PRAYERS WILL BE MORE FERVENT THAN MINE
THE OLD MAN'S EYES REMAINED FIXED ON THE DOOR
D'AVRIGNY RUSHED TOWARDS THE OLD MAN AND MADE HIM INHALE A POWERFUL RESTORATIVE
D'AVRIGNY UNABLE TO BEAR THE SIGHT OF THIS TOUCHING EMOTION TURNED AWAY AND VILLEFORT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND ATTRACTED TOWARDS HIM BY THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNETISM WHICH DRAWS US TOWARDS THOSE WHO HAVE LOVED THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE MOURN EXTENDED HIS HAND TOWARDS THE YOUNG MAN
ASKED MORREL YES
DO YOU KNOW THE ASSASSIN ASKED MORREL
THE NEAREST SAID THE DISTRICT DOCTOR IS A GOOD ITALIAN ABBE WHO LIVES NEXT DOOR TO YOU SHALL I CALL ON HIM AS I PASS
AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS
LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH I'M BEATRICE
BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SOJOURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY
NOW HELICON MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR URANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK
NOR EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
THE GOOD SUPREME SOLE IN ITSELF DELIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANSEL OF ETERNAL PEACE
I SAW THE LADY WHO EREWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
BUT BY THE LARGESS OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT
ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LIMPID ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL
THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED
AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VENI SPONSA DE LIBANO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER
AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERDICTED
NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR E'ER GLADDENED AFRICANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE
BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHYMES
THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOUR CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
I DO NOT THINK THERE SHONE SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM
TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED
AND WHAT ALLUREMENTS OR WHAT VANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHERS SHOWED THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM
IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GAIT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN
WHENCE SHE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO
AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH ERE FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH
THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PROSERPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
THESE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTERMOST APART
DANTE BECAUSE VIRGILIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET AWHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEED'ST MUST WEEP
CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOLE BE OF ONE MEASURE
AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DELIA'S GIRDLE
SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELLING BUT THE PSALM DELECTASTI GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOUD YOUR INTELLECT
YE ARE NEW COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE PERADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST
THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCED BY NEW WEDDED BRIDES
YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOUR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE
SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALREADY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PERDITION
TO SAY UNTO VIRGILIUS NOT A DRACHM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
DOST THOU RISE AGAINST HIM WHO GIVES THEE HIS BREAD
SAID ONE OF THE BYSTANDERS I HAVE GOT THEM AND THEY ARE NOT WORTH THREE REALS
ON PERCEIVING THIS CLAUDIA WHEN SHE HAD CONVINCED HERSELF THAT HER BELOVED HUSBAND WAS NO MORE RENT THE AIR WITH HER SIGHS AND MADE THE HEAVENS RING WITH HER LAMENTATIONS SHE TORE HER HAIR AND SCATTERED IT TO THE WINDS SHE BEAT HER FACE WITH HER HANDS AND SHOWED ALL THE SIGNS OF GRIEF AND SORROW THAT COULD BE CONCEIVED TO COME FROM AN AFFLICTED HEART
DULCINEA IS PERISHING THOU ART LIVING ON REGARDLESS I AM DYING OF HOPE DEFERRED THEREFORE UNTRUSS THYSELF WITH A GOOD WILL FOR MINE IT IS HERE IN THIS RETIRED SPOT TO GIVE THEE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND LASHES
DON QUIXOTE DID SO AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND WHAT HE WAS AFRAID OF
CLAUDIA TOLD HIM SHE MEANT TO GO TO A MONASTERY OF WHICH AN AUNT OF HERS WAS ABBESS WHERE SHE INTENDED TO PASS HER LIFE WITH A BETTER AND EVERLASTING SPOUSE
CLAUDIA WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT ALLOW HIM TO ACCOMPANY HER AND THANKING HIM FOR HIS OFFERS AS WELL AS SHE COULD TOOK LEAVE OF HIM IN TEARS
SANCHO REPLIED THAT ALL THE TREES WERE FULL OF MEN'S FEET AND LEGS
SEEING THIS SANCHO GOT UP AND GRAPPLING WITH HIS MASTER HE GRIPPED HIM WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN HIS ARMS GIVING HIM A TRIP WITH THE HEEL STRETCHED HIM ON THE GROUND ON HIS BACK AND PRESSING HIS RIGHT KNEE ON HIS CHEST HELD HIS HANDS IN HIS OWN SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER MOVE NOR BREATHE
CRUEL RECKLESS WOMAN SHE CRIED HOW EASILY WERT THOU MOVED TO CARRY OUT A THOUGHT SO WICKED
AT THIS INSTANT ONE OR TWO OF THOSE SQUIRES WHO WERE POSTED AS SENTINELS ON THE ROADS TO WATCH WHO CAME ALONG THEM AND REPORT WHAT PASSED TO THEIR CHIEF CAME UP AND SAID SENOR THERE IS A GREAT TROOP OF PEOPLE NOT FAR OFF COMING ALONG THE ROAD TO BARCELONA
DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS PROMISE AND SWORE BY THE LIFE OF HIS THOUGHTS NOT TO TOUCH SO MUCH AS A HAIR OF HIS GARMENTS AND TO LEAVE HIM ENTIRELY FREE AND TO HIS OWN DISCRETION TO WHIP HIMSELF WHENEVER HE PLEASED
AT ONE MOMENT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS AND SAW DULCINEA TRANSFORMED INTO A COUNTRY WENCH SKIPPING AND MOUNTING UPON HER SHE ASS AGAIN THAT THE WORDS OF THE SAGE MERLIN WERE SOUNDING IN HIS EARS SETTING FORTH THE CONDITIONS TO BE OBSERVED AND THE EXERTIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE DISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA
DON QUIXOTE WAS ON FOOT WITH HIS HORSE UNBRIDLED AND HIS LANCE LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND IN SHORT COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS HE THOUGHT IT BEST THEREFORE TO FOLD HIS ARMS AND BOW HIS HEAD AND RESERVE HIMSELF FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE OCCASION AND OPPORTUNITY
THE REGENT'S LADY ORDERED ONE OF HER SERVANTS TO GIVE THE EIGHTY CROWNS THAT HAD BEEN ASSESSED AS HER SHARE AT ONCE FOR THE CAPTAINS HAD ALREADY PAID DOWN THEIR SIXTY
IN A WORD HE PLEDGED HIMSELF TO BE MINE AND I PROMISED TO BE HIS WITHOUT CARRYING MATTERS ANY FURTHER
WHAT LED ME INTO IT WAS A CERTAIN THIRST FOR VENGEANCE WHICH IS STRONG ENOUGH TO DISTURB THE QUIETEST HEARTS
THE WOUNDED GENTLEMAN OPENED HIS ALL BUT CLOSED EYES AND RECOGNISING CLAUDIA SAID I SEE CLEARLY FAIR AND MISTAKEN LADY THAT IT IS THOU THAT HAST SLAIN ME A PUNISHMENT NOT MERITED OR DESERVED BY MY FEELINGS TOWARDS THEE FOR NEVER DID I MEAN TO NOR COULD I WRONG THEE IN THOUGHT OR DEED
IT IS NOT TRUE THEN SAID CLAUDIA THAT THOU WERT GOING THIS MORNING TO MARRY LEONORA THE DAUGHTER OF THE RICH BALVASTRO
AND IF YOU HAVE ANY DESIRE TO SHORTEN THE JOURNEY AND PUT YOURSELF EASILY IN THE WAY OF SALVATION COME WITH ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO BECOME A KNIGHT ERRANT A CALLING WHEREIN SO MANY HARDSHIPS AND MISHAPS ARE ENCOUNTERED THAT IF THEY BE TAKEN AS PENANCES THEY WILL LODGE YOU IN HEAVEN IN A TRICE
GIVE ME MY HORSE AND ARMS AND WAIT FOR ME HERE I WILL GO IN QUEST OF THIS KNIGHT AND DEAD OR ALIVE I WILL MAKE HIM KEEP HIS WORD PLIGHTED TO SO GREAT BEAUTY
ONE OF THE SQUIRES OBSERVED IN HIS MIXTURE OF GASCON AND CATALAN THIS CAPTAIN OF OURS WOULD MAKE A BETTER FRIAR THAN HIGHWAYMAN IF HE WANTS TO BE SO GENEROUS ANOTHER TIME LET IT BE WITH HIS OWN PROPERTY AND NOT OURS
HE WAS MOUNTED UPON A POWERFUL HORSE AND HAD ON A COAT OF MAIL WITH FOUR OF THE PISTOLS THEY CALL PETRONELS IN THAT COUNTRY AT HIS WAIST
WHO IS TOUCHING ME AND UNTRUSSING ME
HE SAW THAT HIS SQUIRES FOR SO THEY CALL THOSE WHO FOLLOW THAT TRADE WERE ABOUT TO RIFLE SANCHO PANZA BUT HE ORDERED THEM TO DESIST AND WAS AT ONCE OBEYED SO THE GIRDLE ESCAPED
MASTER AND MAN DISMOUNTED FROM THEIR BEASTS AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD SETTLED THEMSELVES AT THE FOOT OF THE TREES SANCHO WHO HAD HAD A GOOD NOONTIDE MEAL THAT DAY LET HIMSELF WITHOUT MORE ADO PASS THE GATES OF SLEEP
NOBODY NEED HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT THAT SAID SANCHO FOR MY MASTER HAS A VERY HAPPY KNACK OF MATCHMAKING IT'S NOT MANY DAYS SINCE HE FORCED ANOTHER MAN TO MARRY WHO IN THE SAME WAY BACKED OUT OF HIS PROMISE TO ANOTHER MAIDEN AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIS PERSECUTORS THE ENCHANTERS CHANGING THE MAN'S PROPER SHAPE INTO A LACQUEY'S THE SAID MAIDEN WOULD NOT BE ONE THIS MINUTE
AND NOW THE SQUIRES DESPATCHED TO MAKE THE PRIZE CAME UP BRINGING WITH THEM TWO GENTLEMEN ON HORSEBACK TWO PILGRIMS ON FOOT AND A COACH FULL OF WOMEN WITH SOME SIX SERVANTS ON FOOT AND ON HORSEBACK IN ATTENDANCE ON THEM AND A COUPLE OF MULETEERS WHOM THE GENTLEMEN HAD WITH THEM
THE CAPTAINS SHOWED PLAINLY THE CONCERN THEY FELT THE REGENT'S LADY WAS DOWNCAST AND THE PILGRIMS DID NOT AT ALL ENJOY SEEING THEIR PROPERTY CONFISCATED
THEY MADE HASTE TO OVERTAKE THEM WHICH AS THE PARTY MOVED SLOWLY THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH EASE
BUT DON QUIXOTE WHOM HIS THOUGHTS FAR MORE THAN HUNGER KEPT AWAKE COULD NOT CLOSE AN EYE AND ROAMED IN FANCY TO AND FRO THROUGH ALL SORTS OF PLACES
THEY WERE ALL TAKEN ABACK AND NOT ONE OF THEM DARED TO UTTER A WORD SUCH DEFERENCE DID THEY PAY HIM
HE SAW ME HE PAID COURT TO ME I LISTENED TO HIM AND UNKNOWN TO MY FATHER I LOVED HIM FOR THERE IS NO WOMAN HOWEVER SECLUDED SHE MAY LIVE OR CLOSE SHE MAY BE KEPT WHO WILL NOT HAVE OPPORTUNITIES AND TO SPARE FOR FOLLOWING HER HEADLONG IMPULSES
O HUSBAND WHOSE UNHAPPY FATE IN BEING MINE HATH BORNE THEE FROM THE MARRIAGE BED TO THE GRAVE
SANCHO SAID THEY HAD BUT THAT THREE KERCHIEFS THAT WERE WORTH THREE CITIES WERE MISSING
SANCHO ROSE AND REMOVED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE SPOT BUT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO PLACE HIMSELF LEANING AGAINST ANOTHER TREE HE FELT SOMETHING TOUCH HIS HEAD AND PUTTING UP HIS HANDS ENCOUNTERED SOMEBODY'S TWO FEET WITH SHOES AND STOCKINGS ON THEM
HOW NOW TRAITOR EXCLAIMED DON QUIXOTE
DOST THOU REVOLT AGAINST THY MASTER AND NATURAL LORD
HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND MADE FOR ANOTHER TREE WHERE THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM AND HE FELL A SHOUTING CALLING UPON DON QUIXOTE TO COME AND PROTECT HIM
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MAN
THE SERVANTS WEPT CLAUDIA SWOONED AWAY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THE WHOLE PLACE SEEMED A FIELD OF SORROW AND AN ABODE OF MISFORTUNE
THE PAST HE REGRETTED HE WAS DISCONTENTED WITH THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE HE HAD REASON TO DREAD THE ORIENTAL BISHOPS SUCCESSIVELY DISENGAGED THEIR CAUSE FROM HIS UNPOPULAR NAME AND EACH DAY DECREASED THE NUMBER OF THE SCHISMATICS WHO REVERED NESTORIUS AS THE CONFESSOR OF THE FAITH
THE ZEAL OF CYRIL EXPOSED HIM TO THE PENALTIES OF THE JULIAN LAW BUT IN A FEEBLE GOVERNMENT AND A SUPERSTITIOUS AGE HE WAS SECURE OF IMPUNITY AND EVEN OF PRAISE
RETURN TO YOUR PROVINCES AND MAY YOUR PRIVATE VIRTUES REPAIR THE MISCHIEF AND SCANDAL OF YOUR MEETING
DURING A BUSY PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS THE EMPEROR TRIED EVERY METHOD EXCEPT THE MOST EFFECTUAL MEANS OF INDIFFERENCE AND CONTEMPT TO RECONCILE THIS THEOLOGICAL QUARREL
SUCH CRIMES WOULD HAVE DESERVED THE ANIMADVERSION OF THE MAGISTRATE BUT IN THIS PROMISCUOUS OUTRAGE THE INNOCENT WERE CONFOUNDED WITH THE GUILTY AND ALEXANDRIA WAS IMPOVERISHED BY THE LOSS OF A WEALTHY AND INDUSTRIOUS COLONY
AT THE SAME TIME EVERY AVENUE OF THE THRONE WAS ASSAULTED WITH GOLD
A RUMOR WAS SPREAD AMONG THE CHRISTIANS THAT THE DAUGHTER OF THEON WAS THE ONLY OBSTACLE TO THE RECONCILIATION OF THE PRAEFECT AND THE ARCHBISHOP AND THAT OBSTACLE WAS SPEEDILY REMOVED
BY THE VIGILANCE OF MEMNON THE CHURCHES WERE SHUT AGAINST THEM AND A STRONG GARRISON WAS THROWN INTO THE CATHEDRAL
BUT THE VATICAN RECEIVED WITH OPEN ARMS THE MESSENGERS OF EGYPT
AT THESE BLASPHEMOUS SOUNDS THE PILLARS OF THE SANCTUARY WERE SHAKEN
SIXTY EIGHT BISHOPS TWENTY TWO OF METROPOLITAN RANK DEFENDED HIS CAUSE BY A MODEST AND TEMPERATE PROTEST THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE COUNCILS OF THEIR BRETHREN
ORESTES COMPLAINED BUT HIS JUST COMPLAINTS WERE TOO QUICKLY FORGOTTEN BY THE MINISTERS OF THEODOSIUS AND TOO DEEPLY REMEMBERED BY A PRIEST WHO AFFECTED TO PARDON AND CONTINUED TO HATE THE PRAEFECT OF EGYPT
NESTORIUS WHO DEPENDED ON THE NEAR APPROACH OF HIS EASTERN FRIENDS PERSISTED LIKE HIS PREDECESSOR CHRYSOSTOM TO DISCLAIM THE JURISDICTION AND TO DISOBEY THE SUMMONS OF HIS ENEMIES THEY HASTENED HIS TRIAL AND HIS ACCUSER PRESIDED IN THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT
EXTERMINATE WITH ME THE HERETICS AND WITH YOU I WILL EXTERMINATE THE PERSIANS
WHICH OPPRESSED THE METROPOLITANS OF EUROPE AND ASIA INVADED THE PROVINCES OF ANTIOCH AND ALEXANDRIA AND MEASURED THEIR DIOCESE BY THE LIMITS OF THE EMPIRE
THE VANITY OF CELESTINE WAS FLATTERED BY THE APPEAL AND THE PARTIAL VERSION OF A MONK DECIDED THE FAITH OF THE POPE WHO WITH HIS LATIN CLERGY WAS IGNORANT OF THE LANGUAGE THE ARTS AND THE THEOLOGY OF THE GREEKS
BUT IN THIS AWFUL MOMENT OF THE DANGER OF THE CHURCH THEIR VOW WAS SUPERSEDED BY A MORE SUBLIME AND INDISPENSABLE DUTY
WITHOUT ANY LEGAL SENTENCE WITHOUT ANY ROYAL MANDATE THE PATRIARCH AT THE DAWN OF DAY LED A SEDITIOUS MULTITUDE TO THE ATTACK OF THE SYNAGOGUES
ARDENT IN THE PROSECUTION OF HERESY CYRIL AUSPICIOUSLY OPENED HIS REIGN BY OPPRESSING THE NOVATIANS THE MOST INNOCENT AND HARMLESS OF THE SECTARIES
THE FEEBLE SON OF ARCADIUS WAS ALTERNATELY SWAYED BY HIS WIFE AND SISTER BY THE EUNUCHS AND WOMEN OF THE PALACE SUPERSTITION AND AVARICE WERE THEIR RULING PASSIONS AND THE ORTHODOX CHIEFS WERE ASSIDUOUS IN THEIR ENDEAVORS TO ALARM THE FORMER AND TO GRATIFY THE LATTER
A WANDERING TRIBE OF THE BLEMMYES OR NUBIANS INVADED HIS SOLITARY PRISON IN THEIR RETREAT THEY DISMISSED A CROWD OF USELESS CAPTIVES BUT NO SOONER HAD NESTORIUS REACHED THE BANKS OF THE NILE THAN HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE ESCAPED FROM A ROMAN AND ORTHODOX CITY TO THE MILDER SERVITUDE OF THE SAVAGES
WHEN THE MESSIAH WAS DELIVERED INTO THE HANDS OF THE JEWS THE CHRIST AN IMMORTAL AND IMPASSIBLE BEING FORSOOK HIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE FLEW BACK TO THE PLEROMA OR WORLD OF SPIRITS AND LEFT THE SOLITARY JESUS TO SUFFER TO COMPLAIN AND TO EXPIRE
THE SON OF A VIRGIN GENERATED BY THE INEFFABLE OPERATION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT WAS A CREATURE WITHOUT EXAMPLE OR RESEMBLANCE SUPERIOR IN EVERY ATTRIBUTE OF MIND AND BODY TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM
HE FIRST APPEARED ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN IN THE FORM OF PERFECT MANHOOD BUT IT WAS A FORM ONLY AND NOT A SUBSTANCE A HUMAN FIGURE CREATED BY THE HAND OF OMNIPOTENCE TO IMITATE THE FACULTIES AND ACTIONS OF A MAN AND TO IMPOSE A PERPETUAL ILLUSION ON THE SENSES OF HIS FRIENDS AND ENEMIES
MANY AMONG THE GENTILE PROSELYTES REFUSED TO BELIEVE THAT A CELESTIAL SPIRIT AN UNDIVIDED PORTION OF THE FIRST ESSENCE HAD BEEN PERSONALLY UNITED WITH A MASS OF IMPURE AND CONTAMINATED FLESH AND IN THEIR ZEAL FOR THE DIVINITY THEY PIOUSLY ABJURED THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST
HE LIVED AND DIED FOR THE SERVICE OF MANKIND BUT THE LIFE AND DEATH OF SOCRATES HAD LIKEWISE BEEN DEVOTED TO THE CAUSE OF RELIGION AND JUSTICE AND ALTHOUGH THE STOIC OR THE HERO MAY DISDAIN THE HUMBLE VIRTUES OF JESUS THE TEARS WHICH HE SHED OVER HIS FRIEND AND COUNTRY MAY BE ESTEEMED THE PUREST EVIDENCE OF HIS HUMANITY
IN THEIR EYES JESUS OF NAZARETH WAS A MERE MORTAL THE LEGITIMATE SON OF JOSEPH AND MARY BUT HE WAS THE BEST AND WISEST OF THE HUMAN RACE SELECTED AS THE WORTHY INSTRUMENT TO RESTORE UPON EARTH THE WORSHIP OF THE TRUE AND SUPREME DEITY
BUT INSTEAD OF A TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL ALLIANCE THEY ESTABLISHED AND WE STILL EMBRACE THE SUBSTANTIAL INDISSOLUBLE AND EVERLASTING UNION OF A PERFECT GOD WITH A PERFECT MAN OF THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY WITH A REASONABLE SOUL AND HUMAN FLESH
THEIR MURMURS WERE VARIOUSLY SILENCED BY THE SECTARIES WHO ESPOUSED AND MODIFIED THE DOUBLE SYSTEM OF CERINTHUS
HIS PROGRESS FROM INFANCY TO YOUTH AND MANHOOD WAS MARKED BY A REGULAR INCREASE IN STATURE AND WISDOM AND AFTER A PAINFUL AGONY OF MIND AND BODY HE EXPIRED ON THE CROSS
YET THE MOST CHARITABLE CRITICISM MUST REFUSE THESE SECTARIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PURE AND PROPER DIVINITY OF CHRIST
BUT THE JUSTICE AND GENEROSITY OF SUCH A DESERTION ARE STRONGLY QUESTIONABLE AND THE FATE OF AN INNOCENT MARTYR AT FIRST IMPELLED AND AT LENGTH ABANDONED BY HIS DIVINE COMPANION MIGHT PROVOKE THE PITY AND INDIGNATION OF THE PROFANE
HE ACQUIESCED IN THE OLD DISTINCTION OF THE GREEK PHILOSOPHERS BETWEEN THE RATIONAL AND SENSITIVE SOUL OF MAN THAT HE MIGHT RESERVE THE LOGOS FOR INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONS AND EMPLOY THE SUBORDINATE HUMAN PRINCIPLE IN THE MEANER ACTIONS OF ANIMAL LIFE
THEIR CHURCHES HAVE DISAPPEARED THEIR BOOKS ARE OBLITERATED THEIR OBSCURE FREEDOM MIGHT ALLOW A LATITUDE OF FAITH AND THE SOFTNESS OF THEIR INFANT CREED WOULD BE VARIOUSLY MOULDED BY THE ZEAL OR PRUDENCE OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS
YET AS THE PROFOUND DOCTOR HAD BEEN TERRIFIED AT HIS OWN RASHNESS APOLLINARIS WAS HEARD TO MUTTER SOME FAINT ACCENTS OF EXCUSE AND EXPLANATION
THE WORTHY FRIEND OF ATHANASIUS THE WORTHY ANTAGONIST OF JULIAN HE BRAVELY WRESTLED WITH THE ARIANS AND POLYTHEISTS AND THOUGH HE AFFECTED THE RIGOR OF GEOMETRICAL DEMONSTRATION HIS COMMENTARIES REVEALED THE LITERAL AND ALLEGORICAL SENSE OF THE SCRIPTURES
A LAUDABLE REGARD FOR THE HONOR OF THE FIRST PROSELYTE HAS COUNTENANCED THE BELIEF THE HOPE THE WISH THAT THE EBIONITES OR AT LEAST THE NAZARENES WERE DISTINGUISHED ONLY BY THEIR OBSTINATE PERSEVERANCE IN THE PRACTICE OF THE MOSAIC RITES
UNDER THE TUITION OF THE ABBOT SERAPION HE APPLIED HIMSELF TO ECCLESIASTICAL STUDIES WITH SUCH INDEFATIGABLE ARDOR THAT IN THE COURSE OF ONE SLEEPLESS NIGHT HE HAS PERUSED THE FOUR GOSPELS THE CATHOLIC EPISTLES AND THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS
BUT THE PREVAILING DOCTRINE OF THE ETERNITY AND INHERENT PRAVITY OF MATTER INFECTED THE PRIMITIVE CHURCHES OF THE EAST
A FOETUS THAT COULD INCREASE FROM AN INVISIBLE POINT TO ITS FULL MATURITY A CHILD THAT COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE OF PERFECT MANHOOD WITHOUT DERIVING ANY NOURISHMENT FROM THE ORDINARY SOURCES MIGHT CONTINUE TO EXIST WITHOUT REPAIRING A DAILY WASTE BY A DAILY SUPPLY OF EXTERNAL MATTER
BUT THE RASHNESS OF THESE CONCESSIONS HAS ENCOURAGED A MILDER SENTIMENT OF THOSE OF THE DOCETES WHO TAUGHT NOT THAT CHRIST WAS A PHANTOM BUT THAT HE WAS CLOTHED WITH AN IMPASSIBLE AND INCORRUPTIBLE BODY
NOR COULD IT SEEM STRANGE OR INCREDIBLE THAT THE FIRST OF THESE AEONS THE LOGOS OR WORD OF GOD OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE WITH THE FATHER SHOULD DESCEND UPON EARTH TO DELIVER THE HUMAN RACE FROM VICE AND ERROR AND TO CONDUCT THEM IN THE PATHS OF LIFE AND IMMORTALITY
THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SHIMERDA
FROM OUR BENCH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HOLLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS
SHE ASKED PETER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE KITCHEN SHE BROUGHT A BAG OF SANDWICHES AND DOUGHNUTS FOR US
THE SHRIEKS THAT FOLLOWED MADE EVERYBODY SOBER
WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED THEM
AFTER THE CEREMONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PARENTS OF THE BRIDE
THE FIRST HOWLS WERE TAKEN UP AND ECHOED AND WITH QUICKENING REPETITIONS
THEY WORKED IN CHICAGO DES MOINES FORT WAYNE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UNFORTUNATE
THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GROOM'S THREE BLACKS WENT LIKE THE WIND
WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK
GRADUALLY RELIEF CAME TO ALL OF US
WHEN HE WAS OUT HUNTING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EMPTY LOG HOUSE AND SIT THERE BROODING
THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLEDGES LEFT HE WHISPERED
THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE CLEAR AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE
TWENTY THIRTY ENOUGH
HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP
THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON
ANTONIA'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY
NOW HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO
THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST
THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE
AND THE WOLVES PAVEL ASKED ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US
PAVEL KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLEDGE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER HIM
THEY WERE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILLAGE NOW
I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED
HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WHO HAD WRONGED HIM
QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM
YES HOW MANY
PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SEAT SAW NOTHING
PETER TOLD HIS TROUBLES TO MISTER SHIMERDA HE WAS UNABLE TO MEET A NOTE WHICH FELL DUE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER HAD TO PAY AN EXORBITANT BONUS ON RENEWING IT AND TO GIVE A MORTGAGE ON HIS PIGS AND HORSES AND EVEN HIS MILK COW
WITHOUT A WORD PETER GOT UP AND LIT HIS LANTERN
DURING THE AUCTION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LIFTED HIS EYES
A BLACK DROVE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WEDDING PARTY
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE HINDMOST SLEDGE THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL HE WAS PROBABLY VERY DRUNK THE HORSES LEFT THE ROAD THE SLEDGE WAS CAUGHT IN A CLUMP OF TREES AND OVERTURNED
EVERY ONE SAID PETER KISSED THE COW BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWNER
MISTER SHIMERDA WENT WITH HIM
THIS CABIN WAS HIS HERMITAGE UNTIL THE WINTER SNOWS PENNED HIM IN HIS CAVE
PETER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUTTER
A FAINT FETID SMELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THREAD OF GREEN LIQUID OOZED FROM HIS CRUSHED HEAD
IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRAVEL BEDS THAT I MET MY ADVENTURE
I FOLLOWED WITH THE SPADE OVER MY SHOULDER DRAGGING MY SNAKE
OTTO FUCHS WAS THE FIRST ONE WE MET
I WHIRLED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DRY GRAVEL BEDS WAS THE BIGGEST SNAKE I HAD EVER SEEN
LOOK TONY THAT'S HIS POISON I SAID
ONE DAY WHEN I RODE OVER TO THE SHIMERDAS I FOUND ANTONIA STARTING OFF ON FOOT FOR RUSSIAN PETER'S HOUSE TO BORROW A SPADE AMBROSCH NEEDED
HE COULD STAND RIGHT UP AND TALK TO YOU HE COULD DID HE FIGHT HARD
OTTO WINKED AT ME
THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FROST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HEADY AS WINE
A SNAKE OF HIS SIZE IN FIGHTING TRIM WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOY COULD HANDLE
SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RESENTED HER PROTECTING MANNER
THIS CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADVENTURE WE HAD TOGETHER
I EXPLAINED TO ANTONIA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BUFFALO AND INDIAN TIMES
I KNOW I AM JUST AWFUL JIM I WAS SO SCARED
I NEVER KNOW YOU WAS SO BRAVE JIM SHE WENT ON COMFORTINGLY
WE DECIDED THAT ANTONIA SHOULD RIDE DUDE HOME AND I WOULD WALK
AS LEADING TO THE MENTION OF OTHER INTERESTING EVENTS WE MUST SET THIS INROAD CLEARLY BEFORE THE READER
NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FROM IONA HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY WAS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL
LIKE THE TWO KINGS OF SPARTA THEY REIGNED JOINTLY DIVIDING BETWEEN THEM THE LABOURS AND CARES OF STATE
IT WAS THE SEASON WHEN THE ANCIENT SUN GOD HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO RECEIVE HIS ANNUAL OBLATIONS AND WE CAN WELL BELIEVE THAT THOSE WHOSE HEARTS STILL TREMBLED AT THE NAME OF BEL MUST HAVE CONNECTED THE ECLIPSE AND THE PLAGUE WITH THE REVOLUTION IN THE NATIONAL WORSHIP AND THE OVERTHROW OF THE ANCIENT GODS ON THAT PLAIN OF PROSTRATION WHERE THEY HAD SO LONG RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE
WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEATH THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONA WAS PITCHED ON THE RATH OF TARA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE
THE SAXONS OF KENT AND THE SOUTHERN KINGDOMS GENERALLY WERE CONVERTED BY MISSIONARIES FROM FRANCE OR ROME OR NATIVE PREACHERS OF THE FIRST OR SECOND CHRISTIAN GENERATION THOSE OF NORTHUMBRIA RECOGNISE AS THEIR APOSTLES SAINT AIDAN AND SAINT CUTHBERT TWO FATHERS FROM IONA
SO SLOW AND PATIENT IS THE PROCESS BY WHICH CHRISTIANITY INFUSES ITSELF INTO THE SOCIAL LIFE OF A CONVERTED PEOPLE
IT IS PRETTY CLEAR ALSO THAT THE LAST RALLY OF DRUIDISM AGAINST CHRISTIANITY TOOK PLACE BEHIND HIS BANNER ON THE PLAIN OF MOIRA
NOTHING COULD BE MORE NATURAL THAN SUCH AN ASSEMBLY IN SUCH A PLACE AT SUCH A PERIOD
THE POETS OF SUCCEEDING AGES HAVE DWELT MUCH IN DETAIL ON THE OCCURRENCES OF THIS MEMORABLE DAY
HERE THE HOLY PRELATE OF FERNS MET HIM AND RELATED A VISION IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO DEMAND THE ABOLITION OF THE IMPOST
THROUGHOUT THIS CENTURY THE POWER OF THE CHURCH WAS CONSTANTLY ON THE INCREASE AND IS VISIBLE IN MANY IMPORTANT CHANGES
THE TRIBUTE WAS AT THIS PERIOD ENORMOUS FIFTEEN THOUSAND HEAD OF CATTLE ANNUALLY
SAINT MOLING SURVIVED HIM THREE YEARS AND SAINT ADAMNAN SO INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH HIS REIGN TEN YEARS
THE ANCESTORS OF THE PRESENT PRETENDER CONGAL SURNAMED THE SQUINT EYED HAD TWICE RECEIVED AND CHERISHED THE LICENTIOUS BARDS WHEN UNDER THE BAN OF TARA AND HIS POPULARITY WITH THAT STILL POWERFUL ORDER WAS ONE PROP OF HIS AMBITION
LASTLY THE ROYAL BROTHERS FELL THEMSELVES VICTIMS TO THE EPIDEMIC WHICH SO SADLY SIGNALIZES THEIR REIGN
THE KINGDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA AS THE NAME IMPLIES EMBRACED NEARLY ALL THE COUNTRY FROM THE HUMBER TO THE PICTISH BORDER
THE BARREN ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS
THE ONLY CONFLICTS THAT OCCURRED ON IRISH SOIL WITH A PICTISH OR AN ANGLO SAXON FORCE IF WE EXCEPT THOSE WHO FORMED A CONTINGENT OF CONGAL'S ARMY AT MOIRA OCCURRED IN THE TIME OF THE HOSPITABLE FINNACTA
